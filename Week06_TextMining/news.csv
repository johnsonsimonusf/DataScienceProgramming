After experimenting with different aperture settings and screen brightnesses we found a range that worked well, giving respectable contrast. The quality of the images was pretty good. There were no visible contrast bands. To minimize the exposure time the display program built 255 different 1 bit frames. The first contained a dot only for pixels that had value 255, the second only for pixels that had value 254, etc. These frames were stored using a sparse data structure that was very fast to 'or' onto the screen in sequence. Creating these frames sometimes took 5-10 minutes on that old Mac, but the camera shutter was closed during that time anyway. And yes, we wrote directly to the screen memory. Mea culpa. Our biggest problem was that small images were displayed in the top left corner of the screen instead of the center.

So: if you have a PostScript printer, try: xwdtopnm < xwdfile> | # convert to PPM [ppmtopgm |] # .. to graylevel for smaller file to print pnmtops -noturn | # .. to PostScript lpr # print pnmtops Has several neat options, but use them with care: If you want your image to be 4"" wide, use: pnmtops -noturn -scale 100 -width 4 -noturn Prevents the image from being rotated (if it is wider than it is high) -width 4 Specifies the PAPER width (not the image width - see below) -scale 100 Is used because if the image is small, it may fit within a width less than 4"" , and will thus be printed smaller than 4"" wide. If you first scale it up a lot, it will certainly not fit in 4"" , and will be scaled down by pnmtops automatically to fit the specified paper width. In short: pnmtops will scale an image down to fit the paper size, but it will not blow it up automatically. Hope this helps.

Uh huh. I'll believe it when I see it. I've been chasing fractal compression for a few years, and I still don't believe in it. If it's so great, how come we don't see it competing with JPEG? 'Cause it cann't, I'll wager. Actually, I have wagered, I quit trying to make fractal compression work- and I was trying- because I don't think it's a reasonable alternative to other techniques. It is neat, though. :-) I'll reiterate my disbelief that everything is fractal. That's why I don't think fractal compression as it is widely explained is practical. I know Barnsley and Sloan have some tricks up their sleeves that make their demos work, but I don't see anyone using it in a real product. It's been six years since Iterated Systems was formed, right? "" There are always going to be questions until there's a product out there,"" Sloan replies. The company plans to ship its first encoding devices in the summer, he says. In March, Iterated Systems will have the other half of the system: the decoders. - Scientific American, March 1990, page 77 Allen B (Don't even get me started :-) )",1,0,0,graphics

"I have posted a DOS MPEG decoder/player to alt.binaries.pictures.utilities. Here is a short description and some technical information, taken from the accompanying documentation: DMPEG V1.0 Public Domain MPEG decoder by Stefan Eckart 0. Features =========== DMPEG/DMPLAY is another MPEG decoder/player for the PC: - decodes (nearly) the full MPEG video standard (I,P,B frames, frame size up to at least 352x240 supported) - saves decoded sequence in 8 or 24bit raw file for later display - optional on-screen display during decoding (requires VGA) - several dithering options: ordered dither, Floyd-Steinberg, grayscale - color-space selection - runs under DOS, 640KB RAM, no MS-Windows required - very compact (small code / small data models, 16 bit arithmetic) - real time display of the raw file by a separate player for VGA and many Super-VGAs ... 4. Technical information ======================== The player is a rather straightforward implementation of the MPEG spec [1]. The IDCT is based on the Chen-Wang 13 multiplication algorithm [2] (not quite the optimum, I know). Blocks with not more than eight non-zero coefficients use a non-separated direct multiply-accumulate 2D-IDCT (sounds great, doesn't it?), which turned out to be faster than a 'fast' algorithm in this (quite common) case. Dithering is pretty standard. Main difference to the Berkeley decoder (except for the fewer number of supported algorithms) is the use of 256 instead of 128 colors, the (default) option to use a restricted color-space and the implementation of a color saturation dominant ordered dither. This leads to a significantly superior quality of the dithered image (I claim, judge yourself). Restricted color-space means that the U and V components are clipped to +/-0.25 (instead of +/-0.5) and the display color-space points are distributed over this restricted space. Since the distance between color-space points is thus reduced by a factor of two, the color resolution is doubled at the expense of not being able to represent fully saturated colors. Saturation dominant ordered dither is a method by which a color, lying somewhere between the points of the display color space, is approximated by primarily alternating between two points of constant hue instead of constant saturation. This yields subjectivly better quality due to the lower sensitivity of the human viewing system to saturation changes than to hue changes (the same reasoning as used by the PAL TV standard to improve on NTSC). The improvement is particularly visible in dark brown or redish areas. ... -- Stefan Eckart, stefan@lis.e-technik.tu-muenchen.de",1,0,0,graphics

Note the early use of PostScript technology, predating many of this year's papers listed in the April 1st SIGGRAPH Program Announcement posted here a few days ago. -- Eric Intersection Between a Line and a Polygon (UNDECIDABLE??), by Dave Baraff, Tom Duff From: deb@charisma.graphics.cornell.edu Newsgroups: comp.graphics Keywords: P, NP, Jordan curve separation, Ursyhon Metrization Theorem Organization: Program of Computer Graphics In article [...] ncsmith@ndsuvax.UUCP (Timothy Lyle Smith) writes: I think that this is a very difficult problem. To start with, lines and polygons are semi-algebraic sets which both contain uncountable number of points. Here are a few off-the-cuff ideas. First, we need to check if the line and the polygon are separated. Now, the Jordan curve separation theorem says that the polygon divides the plane into exactly two open (and thus non-compact) regions. Thus, the line lies completely inside the polygon, the line lies completely outside the polygon, or possibly (but this will rarely happen) the line intersects the polyon. Now, the phrasing of this question says "" if a line intersects a polygon"" , so this is a decision problem. One possibility (the decision model approach) is to reduce the question to some other (well known) problem Q, and then try to solve Q. An answer to Q gives an answer to the original decision problem. In recent years, many geometric problems have been successfully modeled in a new language called PostScript. (See "" PostScript Language"" , by Adobe Systems Incorporated, ISBN # 0-201-10179-3, co. 1985). So, given a line L and a polygon P, we can write a PostScript program that draws the line L and the polygon P, and then "" outputs"" the answer. By "" output"" , we mean the program executes a command called "" showpage"" , which actually prints a page of paper containing the line and the polygon. A quick examination of the paper provides an answer to the reduced problem Q, and thus the original problem. There are two small problems with this approach. (1) There is an infinite number of ways to encode L and P into the reduced problem Q. So, we will be forced to invoke the Axiom of Choice (or equivalently, Zorn's Lemma). But the use of the Axiom of Choice is not regarded in a very serious light these days. (2) More importantly, the question arises as to whether or not the PostScript program Q will actually output a piece of paper; or in other words, will it halt? Now, PostScript is expressive enough to encode everything that a Turing Machine might do; thus the halting problem (for PostScript) is undecidable. It is quite possible that the original problem will turn out to be undecidable. I willn't even begin to go into other difficulties, such as aliasing, finite precision and running out of ink, paper or both. A couple of references might be: 1. Principia Mathematica. Newton, I.

The C Programming Language. Kernighan, B and Ritchie, D. 4. A Tale of Two Cities. Dickens, C. -------- From: td@alice.UUCP (Tom Duff) Summary: Overkill. Organization: AT&T Bell Laboratories, Murray Hill NJ The situation is not nearly as bleak as Baraff suggests (he should know better, he's hung around The Labs for long enough). By the well known Dobbin-Dullman reduction (see J. Dullman & D. Dobbin, J. Comp. Obfusc. 37,ii: pp. 33-947, lemma 17(a)) line-polygon intersection can be reduced to Hamiltonian Circuit, without(!) the use of Grobner bases, so LPI (to coin an acronym) is probably only NP-complete. Besides, Turing-completeness will no longer be a problem once our Cray-3 is delivered, since it will be able to complete an infinite loop in 4 milliseconds (with scatter-gather.) -------- From: deb@svax.cs.cornell.edu (David Baraff) Well, sure its no worse than NP-complete, but that's ONLY if you restrict yourself to the case where the line satisfies a Lipschitz condition on its second derivative. (I think there's an '89 SIGGRAPH paper from Caltech that deals with this). -- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ J o n a s Y n g v e s s o n email: jonas-y@isy.liu.se Dept. of Electrical Engineering voice: +46-(0)13-282162 University of Linkoping, Sweden fax : +46-(0)13-139282",1,0,0,graphics

The first one is Ray (or half line) method. In this method, you can draw any ray, if the number of the intersection point of the ray and the polygon is even, then it is outside. If the number is odd, then it is inside. Of cause, you have to deal with the special cases which may make you headache. The second method is PI algorithm. Draw the lines between the point and all the vertices on the polygon. Calculate and sum the angles of the successive lines. If the result is 2*PI, then it is inside. If PI, then it is on the polygon. Otherwise it is outside. My experience tells the second method is relible. Hope this helps. Yeh USC",1,0,0,graphics

Unfortunately, while SGI systems were used to create the special effects for both Terminator 2 and Lawnmower Man, those are film-quality computer graphics, rendered in software and written to film a frame at a time.

Thus, that level of graphics would be difficult, if not impossible, to acheive in real time (30 frames per second). |> |> We certainly want to know more about VR. Who are the leading |> companies, |> agencies, universities? What machines support VR (i.e. SGI, Sun4, |> HP-9000, BIM-6000, etc.)? It depends upon how serious you are and how advanced your application is. True immersive visualization (VR), requires the rendering of complex visual databases at anywhere from 20 to 60 newly rendered frames per second. This is a similar requirement to that of traditional flight simulators for pilot training. If the frame rate is too low, the user notices the stepping of the frames as they move their head rapidly around the scene, so the motion of the graphics is not smooth and contiguous. Thus the graphics system must be powerful enough to sustain high frame rates while rendering complex data representations. Additionally, the frame rate must be constant. If the system renders 15 frames per second at one point, then 60 frames per second the next (perhaps due to the scene in the new viewing direction being simpler than what was visible before), the user can get heavily distracted by the medium (the graphics computer) rather than focusing on the data. To maintain a constant frame rate, the system must be able to run in real-time. UNIX in general does not support real-time operation, but Silicon Graphics has modified the UNIX kernel for its multi-processor systems to be able to support real-time operation, bypassing the usual UNIX process priority-management schemes. Uniprocessor systems running UNIX cannot fundamentally support real-time operation (not Sun SPARC10, not HP 700 Series systems, not IBM RS-6000, not even SGI's uniprocessor systems like Indigo or Crimson). Only our multiprocessor Onyx and Challenge systems support real-time operation due to their Symmetric Multi-Processing (SMP) shared-memory architecture. From a graphics perspective, rendering complex virtual environments requires advanced rendering techniques like texture mapping and real-time multi-sample anti-aliasing. Of all of the general purpose graphics systems on the market today, only Crimson RealityEngine and Onyx RealityEngine2 systems fully support these capabilities. The anti-aliasing is particularly important, as the crawling jagged edges of aliased polygons is an unfortunate distraction when immersed in a virtual environment. |> What kind of graphics languages are used with VR |> (GL, opengl, Phigs, PEX, GKS, etc.)?

"Hi everyone, I thought that some people may be interested in my VR software on these groups: *******Announcing the release of Multiverse-1.0.2******* Multiverse is a multi-user, non-immersive, X-Windows based Virtual Reality system, primarily focused on entertainment/research. Features: Client-Server based model, using Berkeley Sockets. No limit to the number of users (apart from performance). Generic clients. Customizable servers. Hierachical Objects (allowing attachment of cameras and light sources). Multiple light sources (ambient, point and spot). Objects can have extension code, to handle unique functionality, easily attached. Functionality: Client: The client is built around a 'fast' render loop. Basically it changes things when told to by the server and then renders an image from the user's viewpoint. It also provides the server with information about the user's actions - which can then be communicated to other clients and therefore to other users. The client is designed to be generic - in other words you don't need to develop a new client when you want to enter a new world. This means that resources can be spent on enhancing the client software rather than adapting it. The adaptations, as will be explained in a moment, occur in the servers. This release of the client software supports the following functionality: o Hierarchical Objects (with associated addressing) o Multiple Light Sources and Types (Ambient, Point and Spot) o User Interface Panels o Colour Polygonal Rendering with Phong Shading (optional wireframe for faster frame rates) o Mouse and Keyboard Input (Some people may be disappointed that this software doesn't support the PowerGlove as an input device - this is not because it cann't, but because I don't have one! This will, however, be one of the first enhancements!) Servers : This is where customization can take place. The following basic support is provided in this release for potential world server developers: o Transparent Client Management o Client Message Handling This may not sound like much, but it takes away the headache of accepting and terminating clients and receiving messages from them - the application writer can work with the assumption that things are happening locally. Things get more interesting in the object extension functionality. This is what is provided to allow you to animate your objects: o Server Selectable Extension Installation: What this means is that you can decide which objects have extended functionality in your world. Basically you call the extension initialisers you want. o Event Handler Registration: When you develop extensions for an object you basically write callback functions for the events that you want the object to respond to. (Current events supported: INIT, MOVE, CHANGE, COLLIDE & TERMINATE) o Collision Detection Registration: If you want your object to respond to collision events just provide some basic information to the collision detection management software. Your callback will be activated when a collision occurs. This software is kept separate from the worldServer applications because the application developer wants to build a library of extended objects from which to choose. The following is all you need to make a World Server application: o Provide an initWorld function: This is where you choose what object extensions will be supported, plus any initialization you want to do. o Provide a positionObject function: This is where you determine where to place a new client. o Provide an installWorldObjects function: This is where you load the world (.wld) file for a new client. o Provide a getWorldType function: This is where you tell a new client what persona they should have. o Provide an animateWorld function: This is where you can go wild! At a minimum you should let the objects move (by calling a move function) and let the server sleep for a bit (to avoid outrunning the clients). That's all there is to it! And to prove it here are the line counts for the three world servers I've provided: generic - 81 lines dactyl - 270 lines (more complicated collision detection due to the stairs! Will probably be improved with future versions) dogfight - 72 lines Location: This software is located at the following site: ftp.u.washington.edu Directory: pub/virtual-worlds File: multiverse-1.0.2.tar.Z Futures: Client: o Texture mapping. o More realistic rendering: i.e. Z-Buffering (or similar), Gouraud shading o HMD support. o Etc, etc.... Server: o Physical Modelling (gravity, friction etc). o Enhanced Object Management/Interaction o Etc, etc.... Both: o Improved Comms!!! I hope this provides people with a good understanding of the Multiverse software, unfortunately it comes with practically zero documentation, and I'm not sure whether that will ever be able to be rectified! :-( I hope people enjoy this software and that it is useful in our explorations of the Virtual Universe - I've certainly found fascinating developing it, and I would *LOVE* to add support for the PowerGlove...and an HMD :-)!!

Version 1.21 is mainly a bugfix for THINK C users. THIS VERSION NOW RUNS WITH THINK C, I PROMISE! The Docs now contain a chapter for C programmers on how to use the GrafSys. If you have problems, feel free to contact me. The other change is that I removed the FastPerfTrig calls from the FPU version to make it run faster. Those of you who don't know what all this is about, read on. ******** Programmers 3D GrafSys -- What it is: ------------------------------------- Didn't you always have this great game in mind where you needed some way of drawing three-dimensional scenes? Didn't you always want to write this program that visualized the structure of three-dimensional molecules? And didn't the task of writing your 3D conversions routines keep you from actually doing it? Well if the answer to any of the above questions is 'Yes, but what has it to do with this package???' , read on. GrafSys is a THINK Pascal/C library that provides you with simple routines for building, saving, loading (as resources), and manipulating (independent rotating around arbitrary achses, translating and scaling) three dimensional objects. Objects, not just simple single-line drawings. GrafSys supports full 3D clipping, animation and some (primitive) hidden- line/hidden-surface drawing with simple commands from within YOUR PROGRAM. GrafSys also supports full eye control with both perspective and parallel projections (If you cann't understand a word, don't worry, this is just showing off for those who know about it. The docs that come with it will try to explain what it all means later on). GrafSys provides a powerful interface to supply your own drawing routines with data so you can use GrafSys to do the 3D transformations and your own routines to do the actual drawing. (Note that GrafSys also provides drawing routines so you don't have to worry about that if you don't want to) GrafSys 1.11 comes in two versions. One for the 881 and 020 or above processors. The other version uses fixed-point arithmetic and runs on any Mac. Both versions are *100% source compatibel*. GrafSys comes with an extensive manual that teaches you the fundamentals of 3D graphics and how to use the package. If demand is big enough I will convert the GrafSys to an object-class library. However, I feelt that the way it is implemented now makes it easier to use for a lot more people than the select 'OOP-Guild'. GrafSys is free for any non-commercial usage.

"Our group recently bought a Mitsubishi P78U video printer and I could use some help with it. We bought this thing because it (1) has a parallel data input in addition to the usual video signal inputs and (2) claimed to print 256 gray level images. However, the manual that came with it only describes how to format the parallel data to print 1 and 4 bit/pixel images. After some initial problems with the parallel interface I now have this thing running from a parallel port of an Hewlett-Packard workstation and I can print 1 and 4 bit/pixel images just fine. I called the Mitsubishi people and asked about the 256 level claim and they said that was only available when used with the video signal inputs. This was not mentioned in the sales literature. However they did say the P78U can do 6 bit/pixel (64 level) images in parallel mode, but they didn't have any information about how to program it to do so, and they would call Japan, etc. Frankly, I find it hard to believe that if this thing can do 8 bit/pixel images from the video source, it cann't store 8 bits/pixel in the memory. It's not like memory is that expensive any more. If anybody has any information on getting 6 bit/pixel (or even 8 bit/pixel) images out of this thing, I would greatly appreciate your sending it to me. Thanks.

OpenGL is a graphics programming library and as such is a great, portable interface for the development of interactive 3D graphics applications. It is not, however, an indicator of performance, as that will vary strongly from machine to machine and vendor to vendor. SGI is committed to high performance interactive graphics systems and software tools, so OpenGL means that you can port easily from SGI to other platforms, there is no guarantee that your performance would be comparable. |> |> What I *am* annoyed about is the fact that we were led to believe that |> we *would* be able to upgrade to a multiprocessor version of the |> Crimson without the assistance of a fork lift truck.

As one of the previous posts stated, the Personal IRIS was introduced in 1988 and grew to include the 4D/20, 4D/25, 4D/30 and 4D/35 as clock rates sped up over time. As a rule of thumb, SGI platforms live for about 4-5 years. This was true of the motorola-based 3000 series ('85-'89), the PI ('88-'93), the Professional Series (the early 4D's - '86-'90), the Power Series parallel systems ('88-'93). Individual CPU subsystems running at a particular clock rate usually live for about 2 years. New graphics architectures at the high end (GT, VGX, RealityEngine) are released every 18 months to 2 years. These are the facts of life. If we look at these machines, they become almost archaic after four years, and we have to come out with a new platform (like Indigo, Onyx, Challenge) which has higher bus bandwidths, faster CPUs, faster graphics and I/O, and larger disk capacities. If we don't, we become uncompetitive. From the user perspective, you have to buy a machine that meets your current needs and makes economic sense today.

"Hi Steve, As the author of Multiverse, I feel I had better respond to your mailnote questioning whether anyone had managed to compile this software - the quick answer is yes! The long answer is yes - but a few have had a few problems with their platforms - not all unix's are the same, you know! As far as "" many bugs"" go, it would probably be more useful to everyone (including you) if you were a bit more explicit! :-) Platforms it has succesfully compiled and run on are: RS6000, Dec Ultrix Sun Solaris so it is possible. The main problem is that I don't have access to other platforms than the RS6000, so if there are portability problems then the only way I hear about them is by people letting me know and giving me a clue as to how to fix it. As far as the software not doing anything, do you really think I would bother releasing it, if that was the case? Perhaps you didn't read the few docs that ARE supplied. The dogfight world is made up of clients only, so if you're in there on your own, then you're not going to see anything! The dactyl world has quite a lot of scenary - so if you don't see anything there, then this is definitely a problem! One final word - if you're not interested, don't bother with it.

"Hi there, I've made a VGA mode 13h graphics library available via FTP. I originally wrote the routines as a kind of exercise for myself, but perhaps someone here will find them useful. They are certainly useable as they are, but are missing some higher-level functionality. They're intended more as an intro to mode 13h programming, a starting point. *** The library assumes a 386 processor, but it is trivial to modify it *** for a 286. If enough people ask, I'll make the mods and re-post it as a *** different version. The routines are written in assembly (TASM) and are callable from C. They are fairly simple, but I've found them to be very fast (for my purposes, anyway). Routines are included to enter and exit mode 13h, define a "" virtual screen"" , put and get pixels, put a pixmap (rectangular image with no transparent spots), put a sprite (image with see-thru areas), copy areas of the virtual screen into video memory, etc. I've also included a simple C routine to draw a line, as well as a C routine to load a 256 color GIF image into a buffer.

But thinking about it a bit, it shouldn't be too hard. 1) Take three of the points and find the plane they define as well as the circle that they lie on (you say you have this algorithm already) 2) Find the center of this circle. The line passing through this center perpendicular to the plane of the three points passes through the center of the sphere. 3) Repeat with the unused point and two of the original points. This gives you two different lines that both pass through the sphere's origin. Their interection is the center of the sphere. 4) the radius is easy to compute, it's just the distance from the center to any of the original points. I'll leave the math to you, but this is a workable algorithm. :-) An alternate method would be to take pairs of points: the plane formed by the perpendicular bisector of each line segment pair also contains the center of the sphere. Three pairs will form three planes, intersecting at a point. This might be easier to implement. -Steve spworley@netcom.com",1,0,0,graphics

"A very kind soul has mailed me this reply for the bugs in CView. Since he isn't in the position to post this himself, he asked me to post it for him, but to leave his name out. So here it comes: CView has quite a number of bugs. The one you mention is perhaps the most annoying, but not the most dangerous. As far as I can determine, it has to do with the temp files that CView creates. CView gives the user no control over where it places its temp files: it just places them in its "" current directory"" . The problem you mention occurs (as far as I can tell) when it runs out of disk space for its temp files. It seems as if CView doesn't check properly for this situation. As Cview decodes a jpeg, it seems to write out a temp file with all the pixel data with 24 bit colour information. Then, for 8 bit displays, it does the "" dithering"" , again writing another file with the 8 bit colour information. While it is writing this second file, it also writes the data to your colour card. Then when it does the last chunk of 8 bit data, it recopies all the data from the 8 bit file to your screen again. (It does this last "" recopy"" operation for its "" fit to screen"" feature, even when this feature is not enabled.) The result of this process is the following: 1) If it runs out of disk space when writing the first 24 bit file, all you ever see is as much data as it has room for, and the last bit of data is simply repeated over and over again because CView never realizes the disk has filled up and disk writes/reads aren't performed. 2) If it has enough room for the 24 bit data, but runs out of room for the 8 bit data, you see almost all of the picture as it does the dithering and writes to the screen card. However, then when it finishes the dithering and recopies the data from the 8 bit file to screen (for whatever reason it does this) one again just gets a repetition of the last chunk of data for which there was room on the disk. This is just a guess, but probably fairly accurate. At least the general idea is on track I think, although I have probably made errors in details about file I/O etc. The way around this is of course to clear up sufficient disk space. The temp files for large JPEG's (1200x900 and bigger) can be very large (3 Meg + 1 Meg ). On some of the largest I have needed in excess of 6 Meg free disk space. CView has a much more serious bug: if you are trying to display a file from a floppy, and you change floppies while CView has some temp file open on the floppy, then CView in certain circumstances will write the directory (and FAT table? I cann't remember) for the removed floppy onto the newly inserted floppy, thus corruptimg the new floppy in a very serious, possibly unrevcoverable way. SO BE CAREFUL! It is incredibly poor programming for a program to do this. On the other hand, when choosing files in the Open Files menu, CView insists on doing a few disk reads every time one moves the hi-lighter square. Incredibly annoying when it could do them all at once when it gets the directory info. And really, how much effort does it take to sort a directory listing?

"Hi to all out there. We have this problem, and I'm not certain I'm solving it in the correct way. I was wondering if anyone can shed light on this, or point me in the right place to look... We have an X-ray imaging camera and a metallic tube with a cylindrical hole passing through it at a right angle to the tube's axis: | || [ image | X-ray source ] || | screen metallic || tube | || | | We know source--screen centre distance, radius of the tube, radius of the hole. We do some calculations based on the image of the hole on the screen. However, the calculations are mathematically highly complex, and must assume that the object's hole projects an image (resembling an ellipse if the tube is not parallel to the screen) in the centre of the screen. However, it is unlikely that the object is placed so conveniently. Firstly, we must transform the major and minor axis of the ellipse. I cannot know what the angle between the tube and screen is. Do I have to assume that they are parallel to do the transformation? How do I do this transformation? Secondly, there is a distortion of the image due to the screen being planar (the source--screen distance increases as we move away from the centre of the screen). How can I compensate the ellipse's axis for this image distortion? So, please can anyone give us a few pointers here? How do we transform the image so it appears as it would if it were in the centre of the screen, and how do I deal with distortion due to the shape of the screen?

"What are the main advantages of this method? I have seen it described, and the algiorithm seems a little bit long. I developed my own method, which requires that the points be in a counter-clockwise order, and returns whether you are looking at the back or the front, similar to the plane eqn method. It uses few calculations however, basically it is several comparisons. The only disadvantage I see is that it must be done after the transformation from view coordinates to coordinates to display on the screen, which means that a little more calculation isneeded beforehand. My method basically figures out whether the points that will appear on the screen are clockwise or counterclockwise. When looking at the back of something, the points occur in an opposite direction from the front, so merely by figuring out which way the points go, you can tell whether you are looking at the back or front of a 2d polygon.

If playoff hockey is any more intense than the regular season variety then it is because the teams are facing each other at least 4 consecutive times in 7 days and hockey being the contact sport that it is, some things will be carried over that might dissipate during the regular season. But that is only for some of the players. Many of the rest, who have been playing with injuries, who miss their families, or who, like Grant Fuhr, would really rather be playing golf, don't really give a damn. Of course I cann't say this for sure, but I believe that this is fairly typical of human nature and I don't think that hockey players are above having what I consider typically human attitudes. With the recent salary escalations the key players are actually losing money by participating in the playoffs. The ones who regard the playoff "" take"" as some kind of a bonanza are fringe players who are unlikely to consistently be a force in the playoffs. Now I know some of you are going to come back with "" winning spirit"" and all of that crap but these players are professionals after all. While they may love to play the game that love is entirely incidental to their purpose, which is, to make a decent living. Of course, the coach is a professional as well, and part of what he is being paid to do is motivate the players. So, if the coach does his job well enough the players may respond with a winning effort. The second season, is after all, merely an exhibition. The true Champions of the league are the division winners, the teams that come out on top after the long struggle of the season. The Stanley cup playoffs merely accord victory to the team that has remained healthy and "" hot"" . The emphasis on the playoffs, with their "" sudden death"" appeal has been promoted by the media and the owners with profit purely in mind. Even if Pittsburgh loses the playoffs, we all know that they were really the best team in the league over the year. They proved it. cordially, as always, rm -- Roger Maynard maynard@ramsey.cs.laurentian.ca",0,1,0,hockey

Winnipeg has a lousy defensive record anyway. Let's put it another way. John Cullen's +/- is terrible. What's your excuse for him? That his powerplay points don't count? Neither do Selanne's... Knowledgeable hockey observers the world over would agree that feeding Selanne so he can score does contribute in a meaningful way to winning. You're worried about Teemu when you have Glenn Anderson on your team? What he does best is score...so I refer you to my comment above. Nope, didn't see it.

He came highly touted as a defensive defenseman, but he's clearly much more than that. Great skater and hard shot (though wish he were more accurate). In fact, he pretty much allowed the Kings to trade away that huge defensive liability Paul Coffey. Kelly Hrudey is only the biggest disappointment if you thought he was any good to begin with. But, at best, he's only a mediocre goaltender. A better choice would be Tomas Sandstrom, though not through any fault of his own, but because some thugs in Toronto decided to threaten his career in order to avoid conceding a goal. Other than that, the award goes to Robert Lang, an uninspiring Czech. Robitaille could easily be MVP, but I'd prefer to give it to Rob Blake who is quietly becoming one of the league's premier defensemen, and if the Kings manage to hold onto him and the rest of our young defense, it could one day mean that we'll let in fewer goals than Hartford.

"Well, I gotta tell ya, last night's Leafs game vs the Devils was a nail-bitter LET ME TELL YOU! It was a well played game by BOTH teams (I thought) but according to the Don and Ron it was the an "" off-night"" for the Leafs and the Devils were outplaying Toronto. Well, I BEG to differ.... IMHO, Clark deserved to be a first star as much as Gilmour did. His fast breaks towards the net and the good opportunites that he created reminded me of the Clark of old. (But not to take any of the credit away from Gilmour). I think the Leafs are playing GREAT hockey. WHY? Well first look at their injury list which includes, Cullen, Ellet, Zezel, Macoun. Of course my question is this....how will the Leafs fare when they are once again "" healthy"" if they are playing this well so far?? Second, just look at their standings, still second in defence, moved from 11th overall to 6th over in the last month, haven't lost at home in last 12 games, 8 game undefeated streak..etc. (BTW, am I wrong or was this Potvin's first shut-out? I cann't remember him having any as of yet.) Well, as of April 3 we see that the race for first in the Norris has truly begun and it will be a VERY CLOSE race between Chicago and Toronto. And the best game of the season will probably be their last against each other. (is anyone lucky enough to have tickets to see this one?) Coming to the stretch and still a ROAR'IN!!!!!

He made no bones about it, the expansion to 28 is on permanent hold until he is satisfied that the current allotment of 26 are fully stable. This means that cities looking for a club in the foreseeable future will have to wait until one team in some location fails or looks to relocate. This is good, IMO.

"Hi. According to my always questionable newspaper, there's a silver dollar being minted in Canada, the back of which commemorates the anniversary of the Stanley Cup. Now, I know full well what coins are used every day in Canada. I can easily fish a few out of my pocket change right now, in fact. My question is, since the loon is the only dollar coin that I know is legal tender, is this just a commemorative coin with no monetary exchange value, or what? Is it the sort of thing that only hockey buffs and coin collectors might covet, with no chance of it being circulated? If it is an uncirculated coin, what's the current cost and what's its potential value? Just curious. If no one knows, I'll take this to soc.culture.canada and rec.collecting (or whatever it is).

McNall has demonstrated with Gretzky that a star brings out the crowds whether or not the team is expected to do well. Very few fans real- istically expect the Kings to do well this year (although I do) and yet they still go out to see Gretzky. This is the marketing strategy - selling the game by selling the stars - that is employed by Baseball and, notably, the NBA and this is the attitude that the new Bettman/McNall leadership is bringing to the league. They have gone on record as stating that they are trying to sell the game on its stars. Timo Salami and Brett Hull are perfect examples of players that real fans know aren't worth a damn and yet, being benificiaries of marketing-oriented coaching strategies, have goal totals that would indicate to the casual observer, the very fans the NHL wants to attract, that these players are indeed superstars. It ain't nearly so simple as this. The casual fan doesn't think about much at all. Can you actually find an adult with a 3 digit IQ who believes that McDonalds makes good hamburgers? Yes but apparently the Rocket has not lived up to his marketing responsi- bilities has he?

However, I'd suggest Kelly Buchberger instead of Dave Manson, who has had a brutal year, his pick for the All-Star game notwithstanding. As for biggest surprise, I'd say that Buchberger had higher expectations this year due to his "" breakthrough"" year (for him) last year, so he didn't really raise his game. My suggestion would be Shjon Podein, one of the callups from Cape Breton during the year. He was quite far down on the depth chart in the Oilers stable of prospects, but made a big impact on the team. He has 12 goals in his 33 games and is only -1. Those are decent numbers for a third-line player who was seemingly doomed to minor-league oblivion. The Oilers coaching staff likens his style to John Tonelli. I think he'll be on the full-time roster next year.

The goalie puts his/her face through a piece of wood (or was it plastic?) with a hole in it that allows only the face and forehead to show. Hair is covered by a cap, eyes are covered by a plastic wrap-type material, and vaseline is put on the goaltender's face. Then, a plaster is spread on their cheeks, forehead, and chin which takes about 12 minutes to dry sufficiently. When it dries, it is effectively a mold of the goalie's face. This is used as the basis of the mask (the rest involves padding the inside, hardening the exterior, fitting the cage, etc. etc. John Blue of the Bruins actually demonstrated the procedure on the show.

"Ten years ago, the number of Europeans in the NHL was roughly a quarter of what it is now. Going into the 1992/93 season, the numbers of Euros on NHL teams have escalated to the following stats: Canadians: 400 Americans: 100 Europeans: 100 Please note that these numbers are rounded off, and taken from the top 25 players on each of the 24 teams. My source is the Vancouver Sun. Here's the point: there are far too many Europeans in the NHL. I am sick of watching a game between an American and a Canadian team (let's say, the Red Wings and the Canucks) and seeing names like "" Bure"" "" Konstantinov"" and "" Borshevshky"" . Is this North America or isn't it? Toronto, Detriot, Quebec, and Edmonton are particularly annoying, but the numbers of Euros on other teams is getting worse as well. I live in Vancouver and if I hear one more word about "" Pavel Bure, the Russian Rocket"" I will completely throw up. As it is now, every time I see the Canucks play I keep hoping someone will cross-check Bure into the plexiglassso hard they have to carry him out on a stretcher. (By the way, I'm not a Canucks fan to begin with ;-). Okay, the stretcher remark was a little carried away. But the point is that I resent NHL owners drafting all these Europeans INSTEAD of Canadians (and some Americans). It denies young Canadians the opportunity to play in THEIR NORTH AMERICAN LEAGUE and instead gives it to Europeans, who aren't even better hockey players. It's all hype. This "" European mystique"" is sickening, but until NHL owners get over it, Canadian and American players will continue to have to fight harder to get drafted into their own league. With the numbers of Euros in the NHL escalating, the problem is clearly only getting worse.

"I haven't seen anyone post this so I will do the honors. Maine beat LSSU 5-4 in Milwaukee on Saturday night. It was quite a game. Maine stormed to a 2-0 lead in the first and looked like they might run away with it. Maine's first goal came inside the first thirty seconds of the game. LSSU came back at the end of the period to cut the lead to 2-1. LSSU came out in the second dominating the play particularly along the boards. The play went quickly with the refs running a no-holds-barred type of game. LSSU scored three more unanswered goals to lead 4-2 at the end of the second. Now it looked like LSSU might just walk away with the game. Coach Walsh, of Maine, replaced the starting goalie Dunham with Snow, who won the game against Michigan. Snow proved to be a much more aggressive goalie. The third period, like the second, belonged to the team behind. Maine scored three unanswered goals in a span of five minutes after the four minute mark. They were all scored by Jim Montgomery, the tournament MVP, and all assisted by Paul Kariya. The last minute of the game bears highlighting. The change to Snow also proved the difference in the end. With one minute to go and with the LSSU goalie pulled, Snow dueled with a LSSU forward in a amazing set of moves by both. Snow won. It was a great way to end the game.

Soderstrom: Absolutely. 4 shutouts in 39 games for a rookie without a lot of defense in front of him. Runnerups to Galley and Fedyk who are scoring a ton over their career best. But Galley thinks he's Paul Coffey (puts scoring ahead of defending) and Fedyk has tailed off big time. Eklund: Was a big question mark this year and was coming off injuries. 42 points in 49 games is not bad at all, and recently he's been a huge factor in the wins they've gotten. Eklund has never had a point a game season in his career, his production is very typical for him. How does he qualify as a disappointment? If anything he's a surprise. My choice would be Roussel if I went strictly by what was expected of players, but I never thought that he had what it takes to be a #1 goalie. My biggest disappointment is Bill Dineen. I thought that he was going to be the perfect coach for this young team, instead he's made too many bad moves and IMHO has cost them enough games to keep them out of the playoffs this year. Any coach that thinks putting Eric Lindros at the point on power plays is a bright idea needs to go back to coaching school. pete clark jr - rsh FLYERS contact and mailing list owner",0,1,0,hockey
"The FLYERS team that can beat any team on any night showed up at the Spectrum Sunday night, and dominated the Maple Leafs thoroughly en route to a 4-0 shutout. Tommy Soderstrom will get credit for the shutout, but he barely broke a sweat until the third period as the FLYERS defense kept the Leafs from mounting any serious attack. Injuries: Pelle Eklund is day-to-day with a bruised thigh. Roster Moves: Jason Bowen was added to the lineup for his first NHL game. Jason was the FLYERS second pick in the first round (15th overall) of the 1992 entry draft. 19 years old, 6'4"" , 210 lbs. In 62 games with the tri-city Americans he had 10 goals, 12 assists and 219 PIM. He plays left wing and defense, he played defense in this game although Bobby Taylor said that Bill Dineen was planning to use him up front as well. Andre Faust was returned to Hershey. He actually left after the second period of the Kings game, flew to Albany, got the game tying goal in a Bears OT win, and played again for Hershey Sunday night. Lines: Fedyk-Lindros-Recchi Beranek-Brind'Amour-Dineen Lomakin-Butsayev-Conroy Acton-Brown Galley-McGill Yushkevich-Cronin Carkner-Hawgood Bowen Tommy Soderstrom in goal. Acton replaced Lomakin in the 3rd period. Game Summary: If the FLYERS played like this every night, they'd be in the playoffs this year. The FLYERS hit everything that moved. They created scoring chance after scoring chance. They snuffed out everything that the Leafs tried to do. Jason Bowen made a good play on his first NHL shift that almost created a goal. He had the puck in the top of the left offensive circle all alone, but instead of taking the shot he found Brind'Amour crashing the net on the other side. A perfect pass and a good shot across Daren Puppa's body should have been a goal, but Puppa made a great save reading the play. Garry Galley gave the Maple Leafs 7th ranked power play the first chance when he hooked Doug Gilmour at 4:25. The FLYERS lowly 21st ranked penalty killing unit was almost flawless the entire game, and set the tone on this kill. The Maple Leafs got almost nothing but long unscreened shots, and the defense swept away every rebound. After the power play, the FLYERS got a goal on an ugly play. Rod Brind'Amour gave the puck to Greg Hawgood at the right point, and he sent a drive at the net. Puppa made the save and kicked the rebound right into the feet of Josef Beranek and Bob Rouse, who were wrestling in the slot. Beranek was able to get his stick on the puck and push it out to Dineen who was skating into the slot from the right circle, and he lifted a backhander over Puppa for a 1-0 FLYERS lead at 8:10. The FLYERS kept the pressure on, and Puppa was the only Leaf keeping the FLYERS from building on their lead for a while. Eventually things settled down and defense prevailed. Each team got an occasional scoring chance, but the goalies were strong. Bowen started giving some Lindros-like checks in his own corners. Then Lindros, who was looking to avenge a hit Foligno gave him, thought he had a chance to even the score. He had Foligno lined up at center ice, leaned into him, and rode him into the center ice boards. The only problem was that Foligno was a little far from the boards, and Mike "" Mister"" McGeough felt that it warranted a boarding call at 15:38 The Leafs couldn't get anything going on the power play as the FLYERS were very aggressive (for a change) on the kill. With time running out in the period, Recchi carried through the neutral zone and handed to Lindros as they approached the Leaf's blue line. They were in a crowd with Wendell Clark and Jamie Macoun, Lindros tried a backhand pass to Recchi through the feet of Macoun that connected to Recchi, but then Clark checked Recchi off the puck. Macoun then tried to clear, but it was weak and went right to McGill who had manned the point. He drove it from just inside the blue line. Macoun got his stick on it and deflected it past his own goalie at 19:55.1. Shots were 13-8 FLYERS in the period. The FLYERS finally got their first chance on the power play when Dave Andreychuk tripped up Rod Brind'Amour in his offensive zone. During the power play, the FLYERS got cheated a little when the puck popped up into the air and Eric gloved it down, but McGeough thought it hit his stick above his head. We could see from our seats at the other end of the ice that it only hit his glove and the replay confirmed, but the faceoff went to the other end. As time was running out in the advantage, Lindros found Galley with a pass across the goal mouth but Puppa made the save. The rebound kicked back to the right corner where Recchi picked it up, passed it out to Eric crashing through the right circle, and Eric one-timed past Puppa at 7:55. With the assist, Recchi moves past Bobby Clarke's 74-75 season, the second best one season total for a FLYER at 117. Eric moves up to 4th all time in FLYERS rookie scoring with 67 points. Mike Eastwood took down Al Conroy at 8:30 to give the FLYERS another chance on the power play. Not much pressure before Garry Galley ended the power play with a slash at 9:19. Not much happened on the 4 on 4, although the Leafs had most of the possession. The FLYERS smothered the Leafs short power play. Tempers flared a little at 13:14. Bowen and Pearson got roughing minors, Keith Acton got a bloody face. Dave McLlwain then took a dive and got Greg Hawgood a hooking minor at 13:46 to set up a 4 on 3. The replay showed that Hawgood's stick stopped making contact with McLlwain long before he spun around and fell. Again the FLYERS smothered the Leafs power play, led by Dimitri Yushkevich. Bowen made a thundering hit when he came out of the box on Pearson. Berehowski tried to perplex everybody with his sloooowball. He had the puck at the point, and just trickled a pass down the slot. He made all the FLYERS look silly as nobody could get a stick on it, and it got to Gilmour at the side of the net, but Soderstrom stoned him. The FLYERS picked things up offensively after the kill was over, but didn't get anything home. Shots were 13-10 FLYERS. The FLYERS were content with the 3 goal lead in the third period, and they decided that if Tommy wanted a shutout, he was going to have to work for it a little. The FLYERS got most of the scoring chances in the first 7 or so minutes of the period, but couldn't get past Puppa. Then the Leafs got tired of Lindros making road kill out of them, and tempers flared. 2 each for Doug Gilmour and Lindros (unsportsmanlike conduct) and 2 each for Glenn Anderson and McGill (roughing) all at 7:02. Terry Carkner then took a kneeing penalty at 7:51 on Gilmour. Again the FLYERS smothered the Leafs power play. At about the 12 minute mark, Dave Andreychuk got a shot away from his left circle that got through Soderstrom. The puck was rolling on it's side, and as luck would have it it turned away from the net instead of turning towards it (think of how a rolling quarter inevitably starts to lean one way or the other). Seconds later Rod Brind'Amour tripped up Gilmour at 12:24 to give the Leafs another chance on the power play. On the advantage, after Soderstrom stoned Andreychuk while lying down, Andreychuk got the rebound through Soderstrom, but from behind the net and it went straight through and was swept away by one of his defensemen. They kept the pressure on, but Soderstrom was equal and preserved the shutout. Recchi cross checked Ken Baumgartner to get tempers hot and start a brawl at 16:01. No punches thrown, Recchi got the initial minor, Krushelnyski Baumgartner and Lindros each got roughing minors. At 17:02 Rouse and Beranek expressed their mutual dislike for each other and got 2 each for slashing to set up another 4 on 4. Mike Eastwood shoved down Ryan McGill in the FLYERS zone as they were battling for the puck, and while McGill was down he ran his stick across McGill's face. The FLYERS were not happy with that at all. 5-8 Al Conroy paired up with 6-1 Berehowski, and started throwing punches. Upward. Well, Al held his own, much to the delight of the crowd. Each got a couple punches in before going down in a head, and Al got a standing O! Penalties: Eastwood 5 (cross check) + game, Clark, Carkner 10 each. Berehowski and Conroy 5 each (fighting) at 17:49. So a major penalty for the rest of the game for the FLYERS. The had no interest in stting on the lead. Hawgood, Galley and Brind'Amour played catch until Hawgood found Dineen all alone in the left circle, he controlled the puck and blasted it past Puppa at 18:39. That was all the fireworks, Tommy Soderstrom would not face another shot. Puppa did, but kept the FLYERS off the board. 4-0 FLYERS, shots were 9-8 FLYERS in the 3rd. Probably the strongest game I've seen from the FLYERS since the All Star break. Shutout number 4 for Soderstrom, all since 1/10. Tied for 2nd most in the NHL, but he's played fewer games than Belfour (6) or the goalie I cann't remember that he's tied with. Next up it's the Winnipeg Selannes Tuesday night in Winnipeg. The FLYERS cannot be eliminated if they win, but a loss coupled with an Islander win that night in Washington would be the official end. FLYERS up to 71 points on the season in 78 games. Last year they had 75 points in 80 games (5 under .500), so they need at least 8 points in their last 6 games to improve on that only by percentage points (5 under in 84 is better than 5 under in 80). Tragic number holds at 3 points with 6 games left. The tragic number for 5th is 5 points, I watched the Rangers blow a 4-2 third period lead at home to lose 5-4 before I finished this up. Why 5 points instead of 4? Well, the FLYERS will win the tie-breaker if they catch them, whereas the Islanders win tie breakers against the FLYERS and so need only a tie. The Rangers could crumble down the stretch as they play the Devils, the Pens twice, the FLYERS, and finish up with 2 games against the Caps. So I guess 5th place could be the goal for the team to focus on.

Canada is in no imminent danger of being overtaken as the primary supplier of players...Sweden, Finland, the Czech Republic, and Slovakia are all relatively small countries, and cannot really produce players at a greater rate than they are already producing them, and the potential influx from the former Soviet Union is severely blunted because the system has been raided and is starved for finances and will take a decade or two, to recover and become a real threat, and the US will just maintain its slow increase. Canada should continue to supply 60% plus of the top hockey players in the world for the forseeable future. Besides we need the European hockey market if hockey is to take its rightful place besides soccer as the two predominant world sports...and since soccer is essentially boring, unlike hockey. Canadians are under no threat...the European numbers will soon saturate, if they haven't already...and by the time Russia comes online again, the NHL should be a world league, and there will be many more teams to stock and many more jobs for Canadian hockey players. In the near team, the percentage of Canadians will mostly decline because of Americans, not because of Europeans. Crawl into a hole and die... Gerald",0,1,0,hockey

Something like this would require more attention by the referee. But you're creating a scoring opportunity where there might not have been one before. I can see the relationship between free throws awarded after a certain number of fouls, but it's obviously easier to score in basketball, there are more opportunities. If a basketball team scores 100 points, that's at least fifty chances made. The average number of shots taken by each team in a hockey game (and this is a total guess) is probably around 40, and a team is lucky to capitalize on maybe 5 of them. You have some good ideas concerning the other penalties, but I think that a player should be awarded a penalty shot only when they had a chance to score and was interfered with. Also, later in the post, you talked about how boring the NBA game you attended was, that play was stopped too often. Wouldn't your penalty shot rule take up more time during a hockey game?

Lines: 53 NNTP-Posting-Host: access.digex.net Bryan Smale (smale@healthy.uwaterloo.ca) writes: My votes (FWIW): Team MVP: Pat Verbeek. He fans on 25% of goal mouth feeds, but he still has 36 goals after a terrible start and has been an examplary (sp?) team captain throughout a tough couple of seasons. Honorable mention: Nick Kypreos and Mark Janssens. Probably more appropriate in the unsung heroes category than MVP, but Kypreos (17 goals, 320+ PIM) has been the hardest working player on the team and Janssens is underrated as a defensive center and checker. I guess I place a greater emphasis on hard work than skill when determining value. Biggest surprise: Geoff Sanderson. He had 13 goals and 31 points last season as a center, then moved to left wing and has so far put up 45 goals and 80+ points. He now has a new Whaler record 21 power play goals, most all coming from the right wing faceoff circle, his garden spot. Honorable mention: Andrew Cassels and Terry Yake. The kiddie quartet of Sanderson, Poulin, Nylander, and Petrovicky have been attracting the most attention, but Cassels is just 23 and will score close to 90 points this season. He has quite nicely assumed the role of number one center on the team and works very well with Sanderson. Yake bounced around the minors for a number of seasons but is still 24 and will put up about 20 goals and 50 points this season. Yake, like Sanderson, started performing better offensively once he was converted from center to wing, although lefty Sanderson went to the left wing and righty Yake went to the right side. Biggest disappointment: Hands down, John Cullen. Cullen had a disasterous 77 point season last year, his first full season after The Trade. Cullen started the season off of summer back surgery, and fell flat on his face (appropriate, since he spent all of his Whaler career flat on his ass, and whining about it). Cullen scored just 9 point on 19 games, was a clubhouse malcontent, commanded the powerplay to a 9% success percentage (>21% with Sanderson), and sulked his way out of town. Worst of all, his 4 year, $4M contract had three years left to run, so no one would give up any more than the 2nd round draft pick the Maple Leafs offered to Hartford. Honorable mention: Steve Konroyd, also subpar after signing a 3 year, $2.1M contract; Eric Weinrich, who showed flashes of competence, but overall has played poorly; Jim McKenzie, who was a much better hockey player two seasons ago than he is now; and Frank Pietrangelo, who only seemed to play well when Sean Burke was out for an extended period and he got to make a number of starts in a row. -SG (a real live Hartford Whalers season ticket holder) -steveg@cadkey.com",0,1,0,hockey

Well, being a Jet fan, I sometimes wish that Bure would get knocked silly too. (Nothing serious, just enough to keep him out of a game. :) In most cases, the owners have very little to do with it. They give their general managers one order when it comes to the draft...find me the best players so that our team will win the Stanley Cup. Whether that player is in Kindersley, Saskatchewan or Chelyabinsk, Russia, if the GM believes him to be the better player, the GM should be drafting him. Where do you get off calling the NHL THEIR league, when referring to Canadian players. It doesn't belong to them, it belongs to the owners. The owners can do what they want. While a 'Canadian content' rule might be enforcable here in Canada, there is enough doubt that it would be enforcable in the US that the CFL (sorry for the football reference) didn't even TRY to push their import ratio rule on the Sacromento Goldminers. Increasing the competition for the 'elite' positions, in most cases, would make players better anyways. (Oh yeah, and how many Europeans play at the lower levels of professional hockey in North America? While there are some that play in the AHL, or the IHL where that's an NHL team's primary farm club, you don't hear of many Europeans playing in the CHL, the ECHL, or on the secondary farm teams in the IHL. (ie. the Jets do have a few Russian players in Moncton, but I don't believe there are any Europeans in Ft. Wayne.)) So with all those teams, there are plenty of positions for hockey players in North America. I'm in favour of the NHL being the league for the premier players in the world. I've grown up with Europeans playing on 'my' team, and some of those players were the among the best in the world. From Hedberg, Nilsson, and Sjoberg, to Sel{nne, Zhamnov, and Olausson, and all those in between and to come, I wouldn't have it any other way.

"Somebody wrote: This brings up a question I asked myself (no answer) when it was mentionned that the NHL could expand in Europe. Would most of the North-americans now playing in the NHL be willing to play for a team in Europe? I do not think that the majority of hockey players are necessarily interested in expanding their cultural experience to that level. (I know I would but I am not a pro hockey player) When one recalls some players remarks in the last few years it makes me wonder how a European expansion could be achieved. Remember these: - Lindros did not want to play in Quebec (for more than $ reasons) - Nicholls ... in Edmonton. - R. Courtnall wanted to be traded to LA only. - C. Lemieux said he would refuse to go to Edmonton earlier this year. I know there are many non-cultural reasons behind these but there is more: - Some american players who played for the Expos complained about the french fact and that the city was not quite like the other US cities. One players' wife trying to make her point went on to complain that she could not even find her favorite brand of nacho chips in Montreal. Anybody knows what happened when all these US football players moved to London, Spain, etc .. for the one year of that new football league (2 years ago?) I wonder what the players association thinks about going to Europe. Myself I would like to see some European teams, but what would be the best way to do it? Marc",0,1,0,hockey

Evans"" ) writes: : : Of course, penalties will have to be changed: : : Roughing: Chauvanistic Males Being Aggressive : Slashing: Chauvanistic Males Venting Frustration : Fighting: Proof That Males Cannot Cope With Their Feelings : NO NO NO! since all the penalties fall into three classes, there should only be three penalties: 1. Foul (Any illegal contact with the other player or his stick with your body or stick). If you get 5 you are out for the game. 2. Unsportsmanlike contact. (An intentional foul). This inlcludes all the current flavours of roughing, fighting and boarding. If you get two you are thrown out of the game, and fined. 3. Technical foul. Bad mouthing the ref, by player or coach. Penalty shot is awarded. Two and you are thrown out of the game. Besides the penalty shot for one technical, if the team gets 5 penalties in a period, the opposing team gets a penalty shot for every additional one, until the end of the period. The victim gets two shots if he/she was in the act of shooting when the foul ocured. This works well for several reasons. First, penalty shots are the most exciting thing in hockey, right? So, it follows that the more the better. Next, when the player is setting up for a penalty shot, the network can take a commercial. Finally, with only three penalties, the network announcers (Don Meredith, Dick Vitale, John Madden, Pat Summerall, and Marv Levy, among others) will be able to tell the viewers what happened before the PA announcer says it. Oh, one other rule. When a goal is scored (10-20 times a period), the play cannot resume until the PA announcer announces it. This way, the network can sneak in a few more commercials. Then, once the PA announcer has told them who scored, the TV announcer can tell you the viewer, and even have a chance of pronouncing his name right. Seriously, though, I actually went to see a NBA basketball game last week, for the first time in my life. I was amazed how boring it was. The play is so slow they actually had fans come out for things like free-throw shooting contests DURING THE PERIOD!. Of course the 'Laker Girls' get to do their routines at least 6-8 times during the game, and not just between periods either. There is a whistle every 30 seconds on average, maybe less. The game is 48 minutes, with 2 minutes between quarters 1-2 and 3-4 and a 10 minute halftime, and it still takes over 2 hours. The reason for this has to be TV. There is plenty of room to throw in commercials, and have the announcer jabber while nothing else is happening. On TV, basketball is fairly entertaining, IMHO. But, it is better to watch it on TV than to be there. If this is the road the NHL is following, then it truly is a sad day. Enough for now. dvb",0,1,0,hockey

It is updated each month and only information currently under discussion or of continuing importance or interest will be listed for more than two postings. Boston Bruins Boston legislators and the developers proposing a new Boston Garden finally agreed to a deal that puts the 19,000-seat, $160 million project back on track to be finished in September 1995. Right wing Daniel Marois will be sidelined indefinitely following surgery to repair a herniated disc in his back. ** Sent defenseman Glen Murray to Providence of the American Hockey League. Buffalo Sabres 1-800-333-PUCK (1-800-333-7825) Acquired left winger Bob Errey from Pittsburgh for defenseman Mike Ramsey. ** Veteran Buffalo Sabres broadcaster Ted Darling will be inducted into the club's Hall of Fame Sunday, April 11. Darling, who joined the expansion Sabres in 1970, was the team's play-by-play announcer on both television and radio until illness forced him out of the booth during last season. ** Recalled forwards Viktor Gordiouk and Doug MacDonald from Rochester of American Hockey League. Calgary Flames Acquired veteran right wing Greg Paslawski from Philadelphia for future considerations. ** Recalled center Todd Harkins and left winger Tomas Forslund from Salt Lake City of International Hockey League. Chicago Blackhawks The $175 million, privately financed United Center, scheduled to open in August 1994, will be home to the NBA's Chicago Bulls and NHL's Chicago Blackhawks. The stadium is owned by entities controlled by the two teams. The owners apparently still have not made a decision on whether the old Chicago Stadium will be razed for parking space once the new facility, located directly across the street, opens. Suspended defenseman Craig Muni indefinitely for failing to report following a trade with Edmonton. Detroit Red Wings Acquired defenseman Steve Konroyd from Hartford for a sixth-round draft pick. Annnounced the signing of right wing Joe Frederick, their 13th pick in the 1989 National Hockey League entry draft. ** Two contrite hockey fans have returned the stolen Michigan Sports Hall of Fame plaque honoring Detroit Red Wing great Gordie Howe. The bronze plaque was stolen more than four years ago from Cobo Hall in Detroit, site of the Michigan Hall of Fame. Edmonton Oilers Sent forward Esa Tikkanen to the New York Rangers for center Doug Weight. Traded defenseman Craig Muni to Chicago for forward Mike Hudson. NHL commissioner Gary Bettman said the Edmonton Oilers' lease with Northlands Coliseum must be improved if the team is to survive in the city. Edmonton Northlands is a non-profit agency set up by the city to administer exhibition facilities including the Coliseum. Oilers owner Peter Pocklington calls his lease with Northlands horrendous and has threatened to move the team if he doesn't get a better deal. He makes no money from parking, concessions or building advertising. The 17,313-seat Coliseum also has few of the lucrative private boxes that produce significant revenues for other owners. Announced center Kevin Todd will not need surgery but will miss the remainder of the season with a separated shoulder. Hartford Whalers Sent defenseman Steve Konroyd to Detroit for a sixth-round draft pick. Acquired left winger Robert Kron and a third-round draft pick from Vancouver for left winger Murray Craven and a fifth-round draft pick. ** The state of Connecticut will begin negotiations to buy the Civic Center from the city in an effort to keep the financially struggling Hartford Whalers franchise in the city. Los Angeles Kings Sent center John McIntyre to the New York Rangers for defenseman Mark Hardy and Ottawa's fifth-round 1993 draft pick. Minnesota North Stars 1-800-800-0435 if calling from the U.S. 1-800-800-0458 if calling from Canada The Dallas City Council has approved an agreement with the Minnesota North Stars that will bring the NHL club to Reunion Arena next season. Defenseman Mark Tinordi, captain of the North Stars, will be sidelined the rest of the season, including any postseason games the North Stars might play, because of a broken collarbone. Acquired defenseman Mark Osiecki from Winnipeg for ninth- and 10th-round draft picks in 1993. Added defenseman Travis Richards from the University of Minnesota. A former employee filed a sexual harassment suit against Minnesota North Star owner Norman Green. Karen (Kari) Dziedzic, Green's former executive assistant, claims Green often instructed her to wear cosmetics, described her outfits as "" very hot"" and "" very sexy,"" once slapped her hand as she was about to eat and humiliated her by grabbing her hand and rubbing it through a client's hair. The Minnesota North Stars, who will move to Dallas after this season, announced that nearly 11,000 season ticket reservations have been made for their new home at Reunion Arena, which has a capacity of 16,800. The Met Center commission has told the Minnesota North Stars that it wants the club out - with its keys returned - at midnight after the last home game. The club is moving to Dallas for next season. The club must pay unpaid interest of $4,492.80 on the team's late rent payment for 1992, which was made earlier this month, and has been instructed not to take property such as the scoreboard and Zamboni ice-surfacing machine. ** Derian Hatcher's game-misconduct penalty was rescinded by the NHL, allowing the Minnesota defenseman to play in the North Stars' last two regular-season games. Hatcher was given the penalty during a fight at the end of a loss at St. Louis on Sunday, April 11. But the league didn't rescind the game-misconduct penalty Shane Churla received. The Stars recalled center Cal McGowan from their top minor league club in Kalamazoo, Mich., to replace Churla. Montreal Canadiens Acquired defenseman Rob Ramage from Tampa Bay for minor league defensemen Eric Charron and Alain Cote and future considerations. New Jersey Devils ** Bernie Nicholls publicly apologized for his criticism of referee Denis Morel after the Devils' 5-2 loss to the Buffalo Sabres. Nicholls was ejected by Morel for being the third man in on a fight late in the second period of that game and afterward Nicholls called Morel "" a homer"" and "" an embarrassment to the referee's association."" New York Islanders Traded right wing Daniel Marois to Boston for a conditional draft choice. New York Rangers Obtained forward Esa Tikkanen from Edmonton for center Doug Weight. Acquired left winger Mike Hartman from Tampa Bay Acquired center John McIntyre from Los Angeles for defenseman Mark Hardy and Ottawa's fifth-round 1993 draft pick. Defenseman Brian Leetch will undergo additional surgery on the right ankle he broke in a non-skating fall and is not expected to play again this season. Leetch suffered the broken ankle March 19 following a victory over San Jose. The team said he slipped on an icy patch of pavement as he was getting out of a taxi cab in front of his apartment. ** Announced that defenseman James Patrick will require surgery on a herniated disc in his back and will not play again this season. ** Returned goaltender Corey Hirsch to Binghamton of the American Hockey League. Ottawa Senators The Ottawa Senators received the go-ahead to build the 18,500-seat Palladium on the proposed location in nearby Kanata, Ont. The projected cost is C$150 million. Construction will be postponed until the 1995-96 season, one year behind schedule. The Ottawa Senators lost their 37th consecutive NHL road game to tie the 1974-75 Washington Capitals for most road losses in a row. ** Assigned left wing Martin St. Amour to New Haven of the American Hockey League. Philadelphia Flyers The opening date of Spectrum II has been pushed back to fall 1995. Formal groundbreaking has been postponed indefinitely. Traded veteran right wing Greg Paslawski to the Calgary Flames for future considerations. Pittsburgh Penguins Traded left winger Bob Errey to Buffalo for defenseman Mike Ramsey. Reacquired defenseman Peter Taglianetti from Tampa Bay Lightning for a third-round 1993 draft choice. ** Revolutionary Comics of San Diego agreed to destroy all available copies of a Mario Lemieux comic book in a settlement with the Pittsburgh Penguins over a trademark infringement lawsuit. The Penguins sued in February charging that the "" Sport Stars Mario Lemieux"" comic infringed on the team's logo and uniform, which are registered trademarks. Quebec Nordiques 1-800-463-3333 St. Louis Blues St. Louis Blues center Ron Sutter will miss the rest of the season as a result of separating his right shoulder. San Jose Sharks The San Jose Sharks announced that ticket prices will increase by about 30% for the 1993-94 season when they move from the Cow Palace into a new $155-million arena in San Jose. ** Recalled defenseman Tom Pederson from Kansas City of the International Hockey League. ** Reached agreement in principle with left wing Alexander Cherbayev. Tampa Bay Lightning 1-800-881-2639 At least two investor groups are poised to build a sports arena in downtown Tampa if the delay-plagued company that holds a lease from the Tampa Bay Lightning bows out. Tampa Coliseum Inc. has a lease with the National Hockey League team to develop an entertainment and sports arena next to Tampa Stadium, but has been unable to raise enough money for the project. Sent left winger Mike Hartman to the New York Rangers for center Randy Gilhen. Sent defenseman Peter Taglianetti to Pittsburgh for a third-round 1993 draft choice. Sent defenseman Rob Ramage to the Montreal Canadiens for minor league defensemen Eric Charron and Alain Cote and future considerations. ** Manon Rheaume's first starting appearance in goal for the Atlanta Knights was impressive enough for her coach to say she has a chance to be a backup goalie for another minor league team next season. Rheaume, the first female to play professional hockey, stopped 25 shots and gave up six goals against the Cincinnati Cyclones on Saturday night, April 10. After the game, her coach, Gene Ubriaco, said Rheaume performed well enough to compete for the No. 2 goalie spot with the Louisville IceHawks of the East Coast Hockey League next season. The Knights and the IceHawks are minor league clubs of the Tampa Bay Lightning. ** As their first season comes to a close, there are rumors swirling that the Tampa Bay Lightning just might become the Atlanta Lightning. Or the Minnesota Lightning. But they are just rumors, according to Lightning general manager Phil Esposito. ESPN reported on Sunday, April 11, that the Lightning, who have been playing in 10,400-seat Expo Hall, are exploring opportunities to move to either Atlanta or Minneapolis. But Esposito said there was no truth to the report. "" We were disappointed with ESPN's irresponsible comment,"" Esposito said. "" There is just no substance to the rumor."" Rumors have been swirling for the past two years regarding a move by Tampa Bay, which is presently discussing plans to build a new arena. Toronto Maple Leafs ** Defenseman Matt Martin, who helped Maine win the 1993 NCAA hockey championship, gave up his final year of eligibility and signed a contract with the Toronto Maple Leafs. Vancouver Canucks The Vancouver Canucks have cleared the last hurdle in their effort to build a new stadium. Vancouver council has given the green light for the 100 million dollar complex. It will seat 20 thousand people and will have an adjoining office tower. It will be built between the viaducts near B.C. Place in Vancouver. Site preparation will begin this summer, with a completion date of Fall 1995. Traded left winger Robert Kron and a third-round draft pick to Hartford for left winger Murray Craven and a fifth-round draft pick. Obtained defenseman Dan Ratushny from Winnipeg for a ninth-round draft pick. ** Signed right wing Brian Loney to a multi-year contract and assigned him to Hamilton of American Hockey League (AHL). Washington Capitals (301) 808-CAPS Traded goaltender Jim Hrivnak and future considerations to Winnipeg for goaltender Rick Tabaracci. Winnipeg Jets Winnipeg Jets have been allowed economic assistance in order to keep them in the Smythe division as a result of expansion. Sent defenseman Mark Osiecki to Minnesota for ninth- and 10th-round draft picks in 1993. Sent goaltender Rick Tabaracci to Washington for Jim Hrivnak and future considerations. Sent defenseman Dan Ratushny to Vancouver for a ninth-round draft pick. Winnipeg's Teemu Selanne broke the NHL's rookie points record. The Jets rookie tied the record of 109 points, set by Peter Stastny with Quebec (1980-81), with a goal, his 66th of the season, and moved ahead on an assist in a 5-4 loss to Toronto. ** The Fort Wayne Komets said they have been told by Winnipeg that the Jets will keep a minor league affiliation with Moncton of the American Hockey League. There have been reports the Jets would move players from Moncton to Fort Wayne next season. ----- - Expansion news: The National Hockey League announced that the expansion Anaheim and South Florida franchises will join the league for the 1993- 1994 season. Disney and National Hockey League officials announced Monday, March 1, that the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim, Disney's expansion team, will take to the ice next fall. Michael Eisner, chairman and chief executive officer of the Walt Disney Co., said the Mighty Ducks will play at the Pond, the new Anaheim sports arena, near Disney's flagship theme park. The arena is under construction and will be completed in June. The Pond seats 17,350. The team still must meet the league's requirement that it sell at least 10,000 season tickets for the final grant of NHL membership. Anaheim named Jack Ferreira general manager and Pierre Gauthier assistant general manager. ** Veteran NHL scout Al Godfrey has been hired as the Midwest regional scout for the Anaheim Mighty Ducks. Philadelphia Flyers' senior vice president Bobby Clarke was named Monday, March 1, to the post of general manager for Miami's NHL expansion team. Franchise owner H. Wayne Huizenga made the announcement at the Miami Arena, three months after being awarded a franchise. Huizenga said he plans to have a team on the ice in time for the beginning of the NHL season in October. ----- - Realignment: Eastern Conference Atlantic Division Washington Capitals, New Jersey Devils, New York Islanders, New York Rangers, Philadelphia Flyers, South Florida, Tampa Bay Lightning Northeast Division Boston Bruins, Buffalo Sabres, Hartford Whalers, Montreal Canadiens, Ottawa Senators, Pittsburgh Penguins, Quebec Nordiques Western Conference Central Division Chicago Blackhawks, Dallas Stars, Detroit Red Wings, St. Louis Blues, Toronto Maple Leafs, Winnipeg Jets Pacific Division Anaheim Mighty Ducks, Calgary Flames, Edmonton Oilers, Los Angeles Kings, San Jose Sharks, Vancouver Canucks Schedule: Eastern Conference teams will play five games against each of six divisional opponents (30); four games against each of the seven teams in the conference's other division (28) and two games against each of the 12 Western Conference members (24). Western Conference teams will play six games against each of five divisional opponents (30); four games against each of the six teams in the conference's other division (24) and two games against each of the 14 Eastern Conference clubs (28). Playoffs: The system will be conference-based, with the No. 1 team meeting the No. 8 team in the first round, No. 2 vs. No. 7, No. 3 vs. No. 6 and No. 4 vs. No. 5. Matchups will be based on overall points with the four division champions being placed in the first- or second-place seeds in each conference and being assured of home-ice in the first two playoff rounds. All series will be best of seven (2-2-1-1-1 rotation) except matchups between Central and Pacific teams. Those series will rotate 2-3- 2 to reduce travel. In those cases, the team with the most regular-season points will choose whether to start the series at home or away. ----- - Draft news: Under terms of the new expansion draft, which will be held in June, each of the 24 existing clubs will be allowed to protect one goaltender, five defensemen and nine forwards. The most recent expansion drafts allowed teams to protect two goalies and did not make a distinction between forwards and defensemen. First-year pros only will be exempt from the draft, which is down from the two-year exemption teams had last season. San Jose, Tampa Bay and Ottawa still will be allowed to exempt second-year pros. Each of the 24 teams will lose two players, with a maximum loss of one goaltender and a maximum loss of one defenseman. The one exception is that a team which loses a goaltender can then no longer lose a defenseman. At the end of the first phase of the draft, the two new franchises will have three goaltenders, eight defensemen and 13 forwards for a total of 24 players. A second phase then will be conducted where San Jose, Tampa Bay and Ottawa will select two players each from the rosters of the two new teams. Ottawa, Tampa Bay and San Jose will be guaranteed priority drafting selection in the 1993 draft as long as they have the three worst records. Anaheim and Miami will choose no lower than fourth and fifth. The expansion franchises will move up in the draft should either San Jose, Tampa Bay or Ottawa not finish in the bottom three positions. The two new teams will pick first and second in the 1994 Entry Draft, regardless of their finish in 1993-94. Should either of the two new teams not play next season they would have priority drafting position in 1994. The owners announced the 1994 draft will be in Hartford and the 1995 draft in Winnipeg. The 1994 draft was scheduled for Boston, but a delay in the construction of a new arena required the draft be moved. ----- - League news: Disputes: The NHL owners and players have resolved differences over salary arbitration procedures, clearing the way for about 40 hearings. NHLPA executive director Bob Goodenow didn't disclose how the issues were resolved, but the prior sticking point had been the manner in which statistics were used in arbitration hearings. Olympics: The NHL announced February 26, 1993, it will not make professional players available to compete in the 1994 Winter Olympics. League Leadership: Los Angeles Kings owner Bruce McNall succeeded Blackhawks owner Bill Wirtz as chairman of the NHL's powerful Board of Governors. Appointed to join McNall on the Executive Committee were Ron Corey of the Montreal Canadiens, Mike Ilitch of the Detroit Red Wings, Peter Pocklington of the Edmonton Oilers and Ed Snider of the Philadelphia Flyers. Gary Bettman, vice president and general counsel of the National Basketball Association, was named commissioner of the National Hockey League, Friday, December 11, 1992. Miscellaneous: Henri Richard, Bernie Parent and Billy Smith have been named special ambassadors for the Stanley Cup Centennial, a season-long celebration of the NHL championship trophy. The trio will appear at league-wide function such as the All-Star Game and Stanley Cup playoffs. The National Hockey League named John N. Turner, former Prime Minister of Canada, to serve on Board of Directors of Hockey Hall of Fame and Museum and nominated Scotty Morrison, David M. Taylor, Larry Bertuzzi, Robert G. Bundy, Walter Bush, Murray Costello, Jim Gregory, Leslie Kaplan, Lawrence G. Meyer and Alan Tonks to serve on Board, which takes office March 30. NHL President Gil Stein was one of four individuals elected to the Hockey Hall of Fame Builder's category. The others were Buffalo Sabres' Chairman of the Board and President Seymour Knox III, Vancouver Canucks' Chairman Frank Griffiths and veteran Canadian hockey executive Fred Page. Former NHL linesman John D'Amico was selected in the Hall of Fame's Referee-Linesman category. ----- - NHL TV Games are carried on TSN and CBC in Canada, on ESPN in the U.S. Check your local listings. The National Hockey League has struck a conditional five-year deal with ESPN to televise professional hockey through the 1996-97 season. The series of agreements grants ESPN exclusive national coverage of the NHL starting with the 1992-93 season, and the cable network has an option to extend the term of that domestic agreement for four more years. The deal also grants ESPN exclusive international television distribution, excluding Canada, for the next five years. The league's new TV contract calls for ESPN to televise up to 25 regular-season games to its domestic audience this coming season and 37 playoff games, including the entire Stanley Cup Final. The majority of ESPN's regular-season games will be televised on Friday nights. NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman announced Wednesday, March 3, that ABC Sports will televise five Stanley Cup playoff games starting next month.

"After watching the Pengiuns all year (and as many other teams as possible), I've really noticed an increase in Tom Barasso's cheap shots this year (and not noticed a corrsponding increase with other goaltenders). I've also noticed that he usually gets away with it. Just as examples last night, I noticed him elbowing Scott Stevens in the head, which basically started the whole shoving match that got Stevens (Scott) and Tocchet 2 minute minors. He also KICKED John McLean. Of course he wasn't called for that. Isn't kicking an automatic match penalty and 10 game suspension? I think Glenn Anderson got one a few years ago for kicking Gaetan Duchesne in the chest. There's no doubt in my mind that Barasso is the dirtiest golatender since Hextall. He's also very good. How about that Tocchet head-butt? Is there an automatic susppension that goes along with a (non-kicking) match penalty? I cann't remember anymore. Oh, the playoffs should be fun, Ralph",0,1,0,hockey

I'd take a whole team of Chelioses if I could. (That way, when one got a penalty the others could kill it!) Ralph",0,1,0,hockey
"mattb@hawk.samsung.com (Matt Brown) writes: [more about the Messier-Samuelsson incident] I agree with Rick that Ulf's cross check wasn't illegal. It was the kind of check you see a dozen times during a game without being called. Slo-mos sometimes have a tendency to make things look worse than they really are. Besides, if Messier cann't take the heat, he should stay out of the kitchen. Well Matt, Mattias Timmander hasn't been playing with the MoDo elite league team yet (just the MoDo junior team), so I predict he needs a few more years here before he can join the B's. I saw him play in the Swedish championship game for junior players this year, and he played very well, a physical game, but not the kind of rough stuff that Ulfie does (I suspect you would like to have a Ulf type-of-player on the B's team too? :) As for Mariusz Czerkawski, he has had a *great* season for Hammarby in division 1. He scored -if I remember correctly- 93 points this season, and then we have to keep in mind that a 50+ point season in Sweden is considered *very good* due to the limited number of games. Mariusz is Djurgarden property (he was just on loan to Hammarby), so he will play in Elitserien next season, unless the B's can get him of course. I would say that Mariusz has to be one of the most exciting player to watch in Swedish hockey this season.

"Well, the Patrick Division got a little more interesting last night. The Islanders lost in OT and the Devils tied the Pens. That means if the Isles beat the Devils on Friday, the will meet the Caps in the playoffs. However, I have some more comments on the Islanders and hockey in general that I need to get off my chest :). First of all, with the Islanders back-to-back lackluster performances against the Whalers, one may think that the Islanders are out of shape. These guys always suck wind in the 2nd period, come on a little in the 3rd and run out of gas too soon. It is unbelieveable how many one goal games these guys have lost. Anyway, the games was pretty wide open. The Isles still have tons of trouble scoring. The Whalers played a golie in is 1st NHL start, I think his name was Lenarduzzi (sp?). (His NHL debut was the Tuesday tie against the Isles). Like I mentioned before, this guy looked like the best golie on the planet for a while (until he misplayed a Mahlakov slap shot to go to OT). I say it's because the Isles don't shoot correctly. Has anyone else noticed this? Also, I think it is really a shame for hockey when I guy like Mick Vukota gets as much ice time as he does. This guy has about as much hockey talent as Jiggs MacDonald (who did play hockey, I think). Anytime he gets the puck it gets stolen, and he always starts fights and gets needless penalties. Richard Pilon is another guy who is on the ice to stir up crap. And he's a defenseman. He's got to be approaching negative infinity for his plus/minus. This guy gets beaten all the time. Why the need for such "" enforcers"" ? Not only do fights slow the game down ALOT, but it takes away from the guys who are really trying to play the game. I'll be one of the few to admit, I do enjoy a good fight once in a while, but only when it's "" called for"" . You know, when a guy checks the goalie too hard. In other words, a violation of "" hockey ethics"" might cause you to get puched. But there is no need to start crap when you are losing or becuase you can get away with it!! Does anyone agree that referees need to be a little less lenient in the 3rd and OT? I mean COME ON already. I'm sick of seeing teams pulling guys down, holding guys etc. just becuase the referee doesn't call it. OT and late in the 3rd should be a time for strategy, not physical prowess. Trying to set up a goal should be first and foremost. If you are so afraid that the other team is going to score that you have to pull a guy down to prevent it, you don't deserve to win in the first place.

"Kevin L. Stamber writes: Markus had a good season in MoDo in the Swedish elite league, scoring 22 goals, 17 assists, 39 points and 67 PIM in 39 games. As Daryl points out, Markus willn't be joining the Pens for this year's playoffs, since the World Championships starts April 18th. But there is a good chance that Markus will join the Pens before next season. MoDo, though, naturally wants to keep their superstars Forsberg and Naslund, so the latest news on this is that MoDo is looking for personal sponsors for Forsberg and Naslund in order to match the kind of money they would receive in NHL. Daryl Turner writes: Actually, Swedish coach Curt Lundmark is thinking about leaving two spots open for additions from eliminated NHLers.

Answer: the shot is totally useless because they lack a forward who stands in front of the net a la` Neely, Shanahan, Tocchet, etc etc. Too bad Demers willn't put Dipietro or LeClair on the powerplay more often. Dammit, even Ewen would at least cause some disruptions. Montreal desperately needs a power forward with some talent, IMO. Then watch them in their own zone. Patrick Roy is screened on everything. Say what you want about his performance; IMNSHO he cannot stop what he cannot see. And Montreal's defence does a miserable job of clearing the front of the net. Last night against Washington Roy played a *great* game. The first goal came on the most ridiculous goalmouth scramble I've seen in a long time, and he didn't have a hope in hell of stopping the shot.

Goaltending is about equal, top offensive players are about equal (Mogilny-LaFontaine vs. Oates-Juneau), but Buffalo has no answer to Neely (not to imply that Neely is not a top offensive player btw, in fact he's one of my favourites even though he's a damn Bruin :) ). And the rest of the matchup wrt lineup favours Boston anyway. But I think it will go six. Agreed here...but Montreal will be pushed to the limit. Is it just me, or does everything Montreal does in the playoffs come down to Roy? Go Habs!! Final I cann't predict a Montreal victory because I've been watching them play for 6 weeks and IMO they severly need some tougher players, especially to play in the Garden. Last time they beat the B's 5-2 but Boston had a clear territorial advantage; the victory was Roy's. At the same time, I cann't bring myself to predict the possibility of a loss, so I'll just say I will not be putting money on this series. :-) Agreed. NY doesn't have the goaltending to stop the onslaught, independent of the trouble they have given Pittsburgh this year. Pens in five, which is credit to NY. Agreed here too, but I think it will go at least six. Jersey has a decent team, and Washington has done poorly against the division this year. I think they will use Tabaracci more after Beaupre gets shelled. I don't think it will go six either...*maybe* five. If Pittsburgh plays Boston, IMO they win in likely five, possibly six. They own the Bruins. If they play Montreal, I think it will go to seven, and once again I willn't be putting money on the seventh game. I say seven because the Habs have played Pittsburgh very tough this season. Chicago will win, but I think in at least six. Chicago is not that good, IMO. And remember that they take ridiculous numbers of penalties. Very true. The Leafs have much to be proud of, but they will soon find out why Montreal did so lousy in the playoffs. Toronto might win two or three at MLG though. Wings in six, maybe even seven. It _will_ be a war...possibly the most intense playoff series of them all. And yes, I think Detroit will win. Probert will have to come up big though. Our first disagreement. Canucks are playing like shit. They don't use their size *at* *all*, which may explain why they get hammered 8-1 by a team chasing them (Calgary)....Winnipeg in six. This is also tough for me to call, because I haven't seen the Smythe enough. I don't think Roberts will be well enough to figure in, Coffey is a non-issue, who cares what Carson has done before, and *never* underestimate Gretzky. LA in six. If it is these two, Calgary will not need six games. But I think it will be LA-Winnipeg anyway, and LA in seven, because of home ice. Wow, must've been tough to go against your team. But let's see, I picked LA-Detroit. Detroit will win, probably in six. If Pittsburgh plays Detroit, it will go longer than five, and I wouldn't bet against the Wings. They are very strong, IMO, and nobody knows *how* strong because they've been underachieving most of the year. If forced to choose, though, I'd have to take the Penguins. A side note. Vlad, last week you said that Selanne was a better player than Gilmour. NO WAY. He is a more talented pure goal scorer...but aside from the age difference, there is no way I would take him over Gilmour on my team. I'm not asking for flames, either, btw....I've spent more than enough time arguing on behalf of Selanne and I still say he's a great player. But while he and Gilmour are both dangerous offensively (give Teemu an edge), Gilmour *does* *it* *all*. I know a lot of Gilmour-bashing goes on, esp. from Flame fans. But IMO you guys are letting your dislike of Gilmour cloud your judgement when it comes to his skill. He is easily one of the best all-round players in the NHL. dchhabra@stpl.ists.ca",0,1,0,hockey

I will grant that a star like Mario will draw fans, even if the team sucks. But this is short term only; I still do not think the attendance increase will last, unless the team is a winning/competitive/improving/butt-kicking one. Pittsburgh was still getting better, so people continued to support them. If they suddenly dropped to, say, 50 points, you'd have knee surgery for some of the people jumping off the bandwagon. Ok. My numbers came from the NHL Guide and Record Book. You can give the credit to Mario since he deserves it. But my point is that it wasn't Mario himself, but it was the *expectation* of things to come (i.e. a winning team) that he created by being the next great hockey superstar. And before anybody jumps in and says I'm nit-picking and mincing words, go back and read from where this thread started... It might help to think about what would go through a fan's mind who suddenly found an interest in Mario and the Pens. Was it "" gee, Mario Lemieux is amazing, I'll go watch him play"" , or was it "" gee, now we've got a *kick* *ass* guy on *our* side, I'll go watch him play"" . I think it was the latter. I don't think this is accurate. The *tickets* sell, but people don't go to the games. I think this thread has already been discussed...season ticket holders in LA don't always use their tickets. So in effect, after the Kings initial success following Gretzky's arrival (68 to 91 points, same source) and corresponding attendance jump, there has been an effective drop in attendance even though ticket sales may not have changed much. Whether or not the Kings are a 'winner' is debatable. I claim that since Gretzky's arrival they have at the very least been competitive...I also claim that McNall has made a stupid move in trying to reassemble the Oiler dynasty...but that's another story and included only because I don't like McNall:-). Anyway, McNall did do some heavy marketing around Gretzky, and that undoubtedly was also responsible for the attendance and merchandising sales, etc. But as I said, when the Kings have been in there little tailspins over the past couple of years there have been empty seats at the Forum even if the tickets were sold. For the short term, IMO. Although I think that it's inevitable that the team will improve with a player such as Lemieux or Gretzky, simply because they make people around them better. Well, at least we are in full agreement here! So are you saying Roger has ever had a valid point? < couldn't resist...> Yes, but they are doing no worse than last year. I think the same type of reasoning I applied to a new Pittsburgh fan applies to all the extra people showing up at Winnipeg games. It's difficult to predict, but do you think that if the Jets miss the playoffs next season that in the year after they will maintain their attendance levels? I seriously doubt it, because in that case the expectation of an improving team would be gone, with or without Selanne. I did provide the example of Rocket Ismail and the Toronto Argonauts of the CFL...did you leave it out because you don't know much about the CFL?

Given the lack of respect he commands, though, I doubt he will win it. The other reason concerns the Pens' team defense. They are hovering around 3rd or 4th in the fewest goals allowed.

The B's have been playing awesome hockey in the last two weeks. The only question is how long will it last? Fuhr is a dud. BOS in 4. QUE vs MON: MON in 7. It seems to me that MON is much like the VAN - no chemistry. The Habs seem to be not in stride. QUE in 5. CHI vs STL: CHI in 4. STL should not be in the playoffs. CHI in 4. DET vs TOR: DET in 6. I am a diehard Leaf fan but ... It seems that the Leafs offense is shutting down in the last week. Can they turn it around against Detroit. As I recall, the last couple of time these two teams met, the Leafs were pummelled. I don't know if Bobbie is allowed in Canada yet. If he is, DET in 5. If not, DET in 6. VAN vs WIN: WIN in 6. Upset in the making here. Another team with bad chemistry. There is something gone foul among Linden, Momesso and Bure. WIN in 6. CAL vs LA: CAL in 5. Anybody that says that LA could possibly beet CAL does not watch the Smythe a whole lot. LA is a bunch of Geritols. CAL in 4. 2nd round: ---------- PITT vs WASH: PITT in 4. It seems to me that Pigsburg has some egos on their team. Their saving grace though is Bowman. He can put anybody in their place. However, if PIGS have a quick first round, they may be a little too high. WASH could be there for a surprise. Having said that, I will say PITT in 6. BOS vs MON: BOS in 6. MON will not be there. BOS is surprising me of late. Cam is great. The couple of wins against QUE last week have sold me with the B's. B's in 6. CHI vs DET: CHI in 7. Yikes. This will not be pretty. But DET is running like a machine of late. They've had a non-busy end of the season in which they played like killers. DET in 6. WIN vs CAL: CAL in 5. CAL has a solid team, a little weak in the nets. CAL will out muscle WIN. CAL in 5. 3rd round: ---------- PITT vs BOS: PITT in 5. I hate PITT. My logic eludes me. The dark side will take over and give BOS the extra push it needs to dump PITT. There may be something to this - if you think of the rivalry. BOS in 7. CHI vs CAL: CHI in 5. Finals: ------ PITT vs CHI: PITT in 5. NO, no, no. We have BOS vs DET. I don't know what to say here.

"The FLYERS closed out the season last night with their 8th straight victory, a 5-4 OT winner over the Hartford Whalers. The OT game winner came from Dimitri Yushkevich, just his 5th of the season and his first game winner. The FLYERS never led up until that point in the game. For the Whalers, the loss marked an NHL record 9th OT loss this season. Roster move: Gord Hynes was called to to play in place of Ryan McGill Injuries: Ryan McGill injured his hand in a fight 4/15 and was scratched. Lines: Eklund-Lindros-Recchi Beranek-Brind'Amour-Dineen Lomakin-Butsayev-Conroy Faust-Acton-Brown Galley-Bowen Yushkevich-Hawgood Carkner-Hynes Dominic Roussel Game Summary: I didn't get TV coverage of the game, and since it was stormy in these parts I didn't have the best radio coverage either. Here's the box score followed by a few things I did pick up: First Period: Hartford, Nylander 10, 8:51 Philadelphia, Recchi 53 (Lindros, Brind'Amour), 19:59.8 (pp) Penalties - Verbeek, Har (holding), :55; Carkner, Phi (roughing), 13:53; Houda, Har (interference) 18:43 Second Period: Hartford, Burt 6 (Cunneyworth, Kron), 2:00 Philadelphia, Bowen 1 (Eklund, Recchi), 7:09 Hartford, Nylander 11 (Zalapski, Sanderson), 9:38 Penalties - Galley, Phi, major-game misconduct (spearing) :58; Verbeek, Har major-game misconduct (spearing), :58; Brown, Phi (tripping), 3:22; Zalapski, Har (tripping), 15:51; Brind'Amour, Phi (slashing), 19:50 Third Period: Hartford, Kron 14 (Sanderson, Cassels), 1:24 (pp) Philadelphia, Beranek 15 (Lomakin, Yushkevich), 3:11 Philadelphia, Faust 2 (Brind'Amour, Roussel), 3:38 Penalties - Houda, Har (tripping), 4:20; Hawgood, Phi (holding), 5:30 Overtime: Philadelphia, Yushkevich 5 (Faust), 1:15. Penalties - None Power Play: Philadelphia 1 of 4, Hartford 1 of 4 Goalies: Philadelphia, Roussel 14-11-5 (30 shots - 26 saves) Hartford, Lenarduzzi, 1-1-1 (38 - 33) On the first Hartford goal, Gord Hynes misplayed the puck at the FLYERS blue line and Nylander stripped him and took off. The Recchi goal was a 2 on 1 with Lindros. The Bowen goal was just a puck he threw at the net, got a good carom and it ended up behind the goalie. On the second Nylander goal he got three whacks at the puck before it went in. This is the most frustrating part of the FLYERS defense. Take the body, and if they get one shot and beat you fine. Don't give them another chance. Carkner, Galley and McGill are all terrible about this, I'll bet money at least one of them was the closest FLYER to the play. That's all I have, my radio got bad after that and I was lucky to know who it was that scored, much less how. From what I heard, Roussel had a very strong game. After the game, Gene Hart asked Bobby Taylor to pick the three stars of the season rather than of the game. It was Garry Galley #3 for his career high point total (I'm surprised that a former goalie wouldn't look closer at his defensive play), Tommy Soderstrom #2 for his team record tying 5 shutouts in only about 1/2 a season and, Mark Recchi #1 for his all time high team single season scoring mark. But here's the odd part. He couldn't decide between Lindros and Recchi for number 1. If he picks Recchi as #1 after he had a hard time choosing between him and Lindros, doesn't that make Lindros #2???? What? You wanna know my three stars of the season? Well, since you asked... #1 Eric Lindros. Eric dominates a game simply by stepping out onto the ice. The difference between the team's record with him and without him is no accident. I believe that the team could have been almost as successful without Recchi. There is no question that this team is significantly better with Eric Lindros on it, and I think that he will deservedly wear the 'C' on his jersey next season. #2 Tommy Soderstrom. 5 shutouts was second in the league to only Ed Belfour, and Tommy didn't have a Chris Chelios (booo) in front of him. He also didn't play a complete season due to heart problems (sentimental edge here, my family has a history of heart problems). There's no question in my mind that Tommy Soderstrom is this teams goalie of the future, and if Roussel complains again about being number 2 look for him to be traded within 2 years. #3 Mark Recchi. Again, you cann't argue with an all-time team high single season scoring mark. There are an awful lot of teams that didn't have a single player get as many points. Plus, Mark is the only FLYER to play the entire season. Not a tough choice. Honorable mentions: Rod Brind'Amour topped his single season high point total which he set last year. The difference was that he wasn't on the top line this year and didn't get as much playing time. Then again, he didn't get the defensive attention that he got last year from the other team either. Dimtri Yushkevich was the teams most consistent defenseman. Yes, he made rookie mistakes, but he was usually fast enough to make up for them. I have a feeling that with his shot he'll score a few more points next year without giving up anything in his own zone, and I suspect that he'll be the teams top defenseman in years to come. Garry Galley was the team's point leader from defensemen. Again, there are some things you just cann't argue with. And he battled with chronic fatigue syndrome, he certainly deserves kudos for only missing one game, and that was against his wishes under doctors orders. But his defensive play often negates his offensive contribution. A little more caution, and a little bit smarter in his own end will make him a much more important part of the team next year. Brent Fedyk was the leagues biggest improvement over last years point total. But consistency became a problem for him. A couple misc notes mostly for mailing list members: Tom Misnik, a member of the mailing list, would like to exchange E-mail addresses with any list members who want to keep in touch over the summer. If you're interested, you can send him mail at: att!ACR.ORG!TMISNIK The FLYERS end the season 1 game below .500 in 5th place, their best winning percentage since going .500 in 1988-89. 14-20-3 within the division (4th in Patrick), 23-14-5 at home. They finished 17th overall, will draft 10th in next years entry draft (Quebec had the 1st rounder, though). They scored as many goals as they allowed, 319. The 8 straight wins is the most since they won 13 in a row in 1985. I will be sending out final stats as soon as I get the issue of the Hockey News that contains them, since there are no more games for me to go to I have no other way of getting them. I hope you've all enjoyed this years hockey season as much as I have. Knowing the future that we have coming to us made missing the playoffs one more time almost bearable.

"In article < 1993Apr5.151818.27409@trentu.ca> xtkmg@trentu.ca (Kate Gregory) writes: That's ridiculous! They aren't designed, they evolved. And, much as it discomforts us, in humans a trouble-free birth process was sacrificed to increased brain and cranial size. Wild animals have a much easier time with birth than humans do. Domestic horses and cows typically have a worse time. To give you an idea: my family tree is complicated because a few of my pioneer great-great- grandfathers had several wives, and we never could figure out which wife had each child. One might ask why this happened. My great-great- grandfathers were, by the time they reached their forties, quite prosperous farmers. Nonetheless, they lost several wives each to the rigors of childbirth; the graveyards in Spencer, Indiana, and Boswell, North Dakota, contain quite a few gravestones like "" Ida, wf. of Jacob Liptrap, and baby, May 6, 1853."" More like one in ten. And the consequences can be devastating; I have direct experience of more than a dozen victims of a fouled-up breech birth. It isn't always fatal. But it is often fatal, when it happens out of reach of adequate help. More often, it permanently damages one's health. Clearly women's bodies _evolved_ to give birth (I am no believer in divine design); however, evolution did not favor trouble-free births for humans. My, aren't we wroth! I haven't read a more outrageous straw man attack in months! I can practically see your mouth foam. We're statistically sophisticated enough to balance the risks. Although I cann't produce exact statistics 5 years after the last time we looked them up, rest assured that we balanced C-section risks against other risks. I wouldn't encourage my wife to have a Caesarean unless it was clearly indicated; on the other hand, I am opposed (on obvious grounds) to waiting until an emergency to give in. And bear this in mind: my wife took the lead in all of these decisions. We talked things over, and I did a lot of the leg work, but the main decisions were really hers. I don't know of very many home birth advocates, even, that think that a first-time mother should have her baby at home. But people should bother to find out the relative risks. My wife was unwilling to take any significant risks in order to have nice surroundings. In view of the intensity of the birth experience, I doubt surroundings have much importance anyway. Somehow the values you're advocating seem all lopsided to me: taking risks, even if fairly small, of serious permanent harm in order to preserve something that is, after all, an esthetic consideration. -- Mark A.

"I second what Spenser Aden said in reply. Additionally, it is hard to say what type of response you ar3e having to prednisone since you did not say how long you have been on it. Patients are generally kept on steroids for months before thinking about tapering. Alternatives to daily dosing are every other day dosing, in your case 20mg every other day would be a start. Another option if it is not possible to get you off prednisone is to start azathioprine. Like Spenser said, you should generally be on another drug in addition to your prednisone, like asulfidine. A lot of the specifics about options, though, depends on severity, location, and duration of disease, as well as histology, so take advice off the net for what it is worth.

That was a part of my point. Aspirin has its problems, but in some situations it is useful. Ditto stuff like licorice root. Taking anything as a drug for theraputic purposes implicitly carries the idea of taking a dose where the benefits are not exceeded by any unwanted, additional effects. Taking any drug when the potential ill-effects are not known is a risk assumed by the parties involved, and it may be that in a given situation the risk is worthwhile. Like Prozac, for instance; Prozac has been shown to be theraputic in some cases where the tri-cyclics fail. But Prozac hasn't been in use that long, and it really isn't clear what if any effects it may have when taken over long periods of time, even though it has been tested by present day standards. Should Prozac be taken off the market because long-term effects, if any, are not known?

He has some pretty healthy life style habits, good diet, exercise, meditation, retreats, therapy etc. Anyhow..he is very concerned with this check up. I know really nothing about the disease.

Aunt Millie often gets into the conversation, as in "" they ignored Aunt Millie's headaches for years"" , and then she died of a brain tumor, aneurysm, or whatever. If you can get away without ever ordering imaging for a patient with an obviously benign headache syndrome, I'd like to hear what your magic is. Every once in a while I am able to bypass imaging by getting an EEG. Mind you, I don't think EEG is terribly sensitive for brain tumor, but the patient feels like "" something is being done"" (as if the hours I spent talking with and examining the patient were "" nothing"" ), the EEG has no ionizing radiation, it's *much* cheaper than CT or MRI, and the EEG brings in some money to my department. --- .

The differential diagnosis between migraine and non-migranous pain is not *always* important, because some therapies are effective in both (e.g., tricyclic antidepressants such as amitriptyline, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as ibuprofen). Other therapies may be more specific: beta-blockers such as propranolol work better in migraine than tension-type headache. The most important thing, from your perspective, is that you got relief.

The only thing that seems to alleviate one of these episodes is prednisone. At times she had been on 60 mg per day. Whenever she gets down to 10-15 mg the symptoms become acute again.

The cockpit crew (pilot) limits are somewhat more stringent than the cabin crew limits for this reason. Crew rest requirements address amount of time on duty plus rest time. A tired crew is an accident-prone crew. The only limits I know of for inner-ear problems are in military aircraft, which are frequently unpressurized or less reliably pressurized. Not being able to clear the ears renders aircrew members DNIF (duties not involving flying) or grounded until the ears clear. Flying can accentuate problems if ears don't clear. If you don't have big pressure changes, you may not know that you've got a problem. But if you zip up to 5,000 or 6,000 ft (the usual cabin altitude in an airliner) and then back down to sea level, you may discover a problem. Ears don't clear readily because of allergies, colds, infections, and anatomical problems. The last willn't change; the first three can.

"" Situs inversus"" means that organs are on the wrong side of the body, and can be complete or partial. It is interesting medically because the normal location of organs is caused in part by the "" normal"" rotation associated with ciliary motion, so that in absence of this, laterality can be "" random."" People with situs inversus are quite popular at medical schools, because of their rarity, and the fact that most doctors get a bit upset when they cann't find the patient's heart sounds (because they're on the wrong side). According to Harrison's, immotile cilia syndrom is an autosomal recessive, which should imply that on average one child in four in a family would be affected. But there may be much more current information on this, and as usual in medicine, we may be talking about more than one conditiion. I would suggest that you ask your pediatrician about contacting a medical geneticics specialist, of which there is probably one at NCSU. -km",0,0,1,medical

With "" pseudo"" clubbing, the angle is initially positive, then negative, which is the normal situation. "" Real"" internists can talk for hours about clubbing. I'm limited to a couple of minutes. Whether this distinction has anything to do with reality is entirely unclear, but it is one of those things that internists love to paw over during rounds. Supposedly, only "" true"" clubbing is associated with disease. The problem is that the list of diseases associated with clubbing is quite long, and includes both congenital conditions and acquired disease. Since many of these diseases are associated with cardiopulmonary problems leading to right to left shunts and chronic hypoxemia, it is very reasonable to get a chest xray. However, many of the congenital abnormalities would only be diagnosed with a cardiac catheterization. The cause of clubbing is unclear, but presumably relates to some factor causing blood vessels in the distal fingertip to dilate abnormally. Clubbing is one of those things from an examination which is a tipoff to do more extensive examination. Often, however, the cause of the clubbing is quite apparent. -km",0,0,1,medical

"I noticed several years ago that when I took analgesics fairly regularly, (motrin at the time), I seemed to get a lot of migraines. But had forgotten about that until I started reading some of the posts here. I generally don't take NSAIDS or Tylenol for headaches, because I've found them to be ineffective. However, I have two other pain sources that force me to take NSAIDS (currently Naprosyn). First, is some pelvic pain that I get at the beginning of my period, and then much worse at midcycle. I have had surgery for endometriosis in the past (~12 years ago), so the Drs. tell me that my pain is probably due to the endometriosis coming back. I've tried Synarel, it reduced the pain while I took it (3 mos), but the pain returned immediately after I stopped. Three doctors have suggested hysterectomy as the only "" real solution"" to my problem. Although I don't expect to have any more children, I don't like the idea of having my uterus and one remaining ovary removed (the first ovary was removed when I had the surgery for endometriosis). One of the Drs that suggested I get a hysterectomy is an expert in laser surgery, but perhaps thinks that type of procedure is only worthwhile on women who still plan to have children. So basically all I'm left with is toughing out the pain. This would be impossible without Naprosyn (or something similar - but not aspirin, that doesn't work, and Motrin gave me horrible gastritis a few years ago, so I'm through with it). In fact, Naprosyn works very well at eliminating the pain if I take it regularly as I did when I had severe back pain (and pain in both legs) as I'll discuss in a moment. Generally though, I wait until I have the pain before I take the Naprosyn, but then it takes several hours for it reduce the pain (it's actually quite effective at reducing the pain, it just takes quite a while). In the meantime I'm frequently in severe pain. The other pain source I have is chronic lower back pain resulting in bilateral radiculopathy. I've had MRIs, Xrays, CT scan, and EMGs (I've had 2 of them, and don't intend to ever do that again) with nerve conduction tests. The tests have not been conclusive as to what is causing my back and leg pain. The MRI reports both say I have several bulging, degeneratig disks, and from the Xrays (and MRI, I think) it is apparent that I have arthritis. The reading on the CT scan was that there are two herniations (L3-L4, and L4-L5), but others hav looked at the films and concluded that there are no herniations. The second EMG and nerve conduction studies shows significant denervation compared to the first EMG. Oh yeah, I had some other horrible test, called something like Somatic Evoked Response which showed that the "" internal nerves"" are working fine. Anyway, the bottom line is that I sometimes have severe pain in both legs and back pain. The back pain is there all the time, but I can live with it. When the leg pain is there, I need some analgesic/anti-inflammatory medication to reduce the pain to a level where I can work. So I took Naprosyn regulary for 6-9 months (every time I tried to stop the leg pain got worse, so I'd always resume). Since last November I have taken it much less frequently, and primarily for the pelvic pain. I have been going to physical therapy for the last 8 months (2-3 times a week). After the first month or so, my therapist put me on pelvic traction (she had tried it earlier, but it had caused a lot of pain in my back, this time she tried it at a lower weight). After a month or two, the pain in my legs began going away (but the traction aways caused discomfort in my lower back, which could be reduced with ultrasound and massage). So now, I don't have nearly as much pain in my legs, in fact my therapist took me off traction about 2 weeks ago. Getting back to my original reason for this post... Even if I can avoid taking analgesic for headaches, I really cann't avoid them entirely because I have other pain sources, that "" force"" me to use them (Oh, I forgot to mention that it has been suggested to me that I have back surgery, but I'm avoiding that too). I find the migraines difficult to deal with, occassionally I have to take off work, but usually I can work, but at a reduced capacity (I'm a systems engineer and do a lot of reading and writing). When the pelvic pain is bad, I cann't concentrate much, I usually end up jumping out of my chair every few minutes, because the pain is so bothersome. When the pain in my back is bad, it can cause severe burning in both legs, shooting pains in my legs, electric shock type of pain in my feet and toes, and basically when it gets bad I cann't really sit at all. Then I end up spending most of my time home and in bed. So even if the analgesics contribute to the migraines, the migraines are more tolerable than the other pain sources. I get a lot of migraines, an average of 3 to 4 a month, which last 1-3 days. I've taken cafergot (the first time the caffiene really got to me so I reduced the dosage), but I don't like the side effects (if I take more than two I get diahrea). If I get a very bad headache, I will eventually take the cafergot. My neurologist wasn't very helpful when I told him my problems with cafergot, he said that when sumatriptan becomes available, I should try that. I've tried several other medications (fiornal, midrin, fiornal with codeine, tegretol, and inderal) but they either didn't work, or I couldn't tolerate them. So what can I do? My doctor's seem to be satisfied with me just trying to tolerate the pain, which I agree with most of the time, but not when I have a lot of pain. I've had some bad experiences with surgery (my heart stopped once from the anesthesia - I was told that it was likely the succinylcholine), and I've already had surgery several times. Anyway, the point of what I'm saying is that even if analgesics can contribute to migraines, some people NEED to take them to tolerate other pain. Janice Rathmann",0,0,1,medical

I've heard iodine causes trouble and that it is used in fast food restaurants to sterilize equipment which might be where the belief that greasy foods cause acne came from. I notice grease on my face, not immediately removed will cause acne (even from eating meat). Keeping hair rinse, mousse, dip, and spray off the face will help. Warm water bath soaks or cloths on the face to soften the oil in the pores will help prevent blackheads. Body oil is hydrophilic, loves water and it softens and washes off when it has a chance. That's why hair goes limp with oilyness. Becoming convinced that the best thing to do with a whitehead is leave it alone will save him days of pimple misery. Any prying of black or whiteheads can cause infections, the red spots of pimples. Usually a whitehead will break naturally in a day and there willn't be an infection afterwards.

"I may not be the world's greatest expert on chiggers (a type of mite indigenous to the south), but I certainly have spent a lot of time contemplating the little buggers over the past six years (since we moved to N.C.). Here are some observations gained from painful experience: 1. Reactions to chiggers vary greatly from person to person. Some people get tiny red bites. Others (like me) are more sensitive and get fairly large swollen sore-like affairs. 2. Chigger bites are the gift that keeps on giving. I swear that these things will itch for months. 3. There is a lot of folklore about chiggers. I think most of it is fiction. I have tried to do research on the critters, since they have such an effect on me. The only book I could find on the subject was a *single* book in UNC's special collections library. I have not yet gone through what is required to get it. 4. Based on my experience and that of my family members, the old folk remedy of fingernail polish simply doesn't work. I recall reading that the theory upon which it is based (that the chiggers burrow into your skin and continue to party there) is false. I think it is more likely that the reaction is to toxins of some sort the little pests release. But this is speculation. 5. The *best* approach is prevention. A couple of things work well. A good insect repellent (DEET) such as Deep Woods Off liberally applied to ankles, waistband, etc. is a good start. There is another preparation called "" Chig Away"" that is a combination of sulfur and some kind of cream (cortisone?) that originally was prepared for the Army and is not commercially available. In the summer I put this on my ankles every morning when I get up on weekends since I literally cann't go outside where we live (in the country) without serious consequences. (They apparently don't like sulfur much at all. You can use sulfur as a dust on your body or clothing to repel them.) 6. No amount of prevention will be *completely* successful. Forget the fingernail polish. I have finally settled upon a treatment that involves topical application of a combination of cortisone creme (reduces the inflamation and swelling) and benzocaine (relieves the itch). I willn't tell you all the things I've tried. Nor will I tell you some of the things my wife does since this counts as minor surgery and is best not mentioned (I also think it gains nothing). 7. The swelling and itching can also be significantly relieved by the application of hot packs, and this seems to speed recovery as well. Doctors seem not to care much about chiggers. The urban and suburban doctors apparently don't encounter them much. And the rural doctors seem to regard them as a force of nature that one must endure. I suspect that anyone who could come up with a good treatment for chiggers would make a *lot* of money. -- Gary H.

I'd be happy to go over the insert (in the PDR) with them and explain everything. All too many patients read the insert and panic and then on the next visit sheepishly admit they were afraid to take the drug and we are starting over again at square one. Some of them probably didn't even come back for followup because they didn't want to admit they wouldn't take the drug or thought I was trying to kill them or something. What people don't understand about the inserts is that they report every adverse side effect ever reported, without substantiating that the drug was responsible. The insert is a legal document to slough liability from the manufacturer to the physician if something was to happen. If patients want to have the most useful and reliable information on a drug they would be so much better off getting hold of one of the AMA drug evaluation books or something similar that is much more scientific. There are very few drugs that someone hasn't reported a death from taking. Patients don't realize that and don't usually appreciate the risks to themselves properly. I'm sure Herman is going to "" go ballistic"" , but so be it. Another problem is that probably most drugs have been reported to cause impotence. Half the males who read that will falsely assume it could permanently cause them to lose sexual function and so will refuse to take any drug like that. This can be a real problem for PDR readers. There needs to be some way of providing patients with tools geared to them that allow them to get the information they need. I am involved in a research project to do that, with migraine as the domain. It involves a computer system that will provide answers to questions about migraine as well as the therapy prescribed for the patient. For common illnesses, such as migraine and hypertension, this may help quite a bit. The patient could spend as much time as needed with the computer and this would then not burden the physician. Clearly, physicians in large part fail to answer all the questions patients have, as is demonstrated over and over here on the net where we get asked things that the patients should have found out from their physician but didn't. Why they didn't isn't always the physician's fault either. Sometimes the patients are afraid to ask. They willn't be as afraid to ask the system, we hope. -- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- Gordon Banks N3JXP | "" Skepticism is the chastity of the intellect, and geb@cadre.dsl.pitt.edu | it is shameful to surrender it too soon."" ----------------------------------------------------------------------------",0,0,1,medical

So in sum and to beat a dead horse: (1) When the outputs of a cone are matched for number of absorbed photons _irrespective_ of the absorbed photons wavelength, the cone outputs are _indistinguishable_. (2) Cones are simply detectors with different spectral sensitivities and are not any more "" color sensitive"" than are rods, ommatidia or other photoreceptors.

"The biggest reason why the cost of medical care is so EXTREMELY high and increasing is that NATURAL methods of treatment and even diagnosis are still being SYSTEMATICALLY IGNORED and SUPPRESSED by the MONEY-GRUBBING and POWER- MONGERING "" medical"" establishment. Some examples of very low cost NATURAL ANTI-cancer Remedies are listed in the following article: NATURAL ANTI-CANCER REMEDIES A 3RD OPINION ( Some of these Remedies also work against AIDS. ) DISCLAIMER: This list was compiled from unorthodox sources that have shown themselves to be reliable. The compiler of this list is NOT a doctor of any kind, but is exercising his First Amendment Constitutional RIGHT of FREE SPEECH on the subjects of his choice. ( MOST of these Remedies can be found in ANY Grocery Store. MOST of the rest of them can be found in ANY Health Food Store. What is important is HOW they are used, and what else is EXCLUDED DURING their use. ) (1) THE 7-DAY FAST. 1st day: Eat as much fresh fruit as you want, one kind at a time, preferably grapes. 2nd day: Eat all the vegetables you want, at least half raw, including GARLIC; also, whole kernel corn to help scrape clean the intestinal linings. 3rd day: Drink all the fresh fruit and vegetable juice you want. Preferably start with 16 to 32 ounces of prune juice WITH PULP, followed by a gallon of pure (NOT from concentrate) apple juice, then grape juice. (Stay close to your home bathroom.) 4th day: Eat all the UN-salted nuts (NO peanuts) and dried fruit you want, preferably raisins and almonds (ALMONDS CONTAIN LAETRILE.). 5th day: ONE GALLON OF LEMONADE. Squeeze the juice from two lemons into a gallon of water (preferably distilled), and add 2 to 4 tablespoons of locally-made honey, (NO sugar). Drink one glass per hour. [EVERYone, including healthy people, should do this one day every week, preceded by a large glass of prune juice WITH PULP.] 6th day: Same as 5th day. 7th day: Same as 6th day. All 7 days, eat ONLY the foods listed above for each day, along with your usual vitamin and mineral supplements, plus as much DISTILLED WATER as you want. (2) THE GRAPE DIET. Eat 2 to 3 ounces of fresh grapes every 2 hours, 8 AM to 8 PM, every day for six days. Eat NOTHING else during the six days, but drink as much DISTILLED WATER as you want. (3) APPLE CIDER VINEGAR. Mix a teaspoon of pure apple cider vinegar (NOT apple cider "" flavored"" vinegar. Regular vinegar is HARMFUL.) in a glass of water (preferably distilled) and drink all of it. Do this 3 or 4 times per day, for 3 weeks; then stop for a week. Repeat if desired. Do this along with a normal healthy diet of natural foods. This remedy is especially effective against those types of cancer that resemble a FUNGUS, as well as against other kinds of fungus infections. (4) THE SEA-SALT & SODA BATH. [Please keep an OPEN MIND.] Fill a bathtub with moderately warm water so the level comes up almost to the overflow drain when you get in. Immerse yourself in it for a minute, and then completely dissolve in the bath water 1 pound of SUN-evaporated SEA-salt (regular salt willn't work.) and 1 pound of fresh baking-soda. Soak in this bath for 10 to 20 minutes, while exercising your fingers, toes, and limbs, turning sideways and onto your stomach, dunking your head, sitting up and laying back down, chomping your teeth together, etc.. Among other things, the SEA-salt & Soda Bath neutralizes the accumulated effects of X-rays, etc., as described in the book "" Born To Be Magnetic, Vol. 2"" , by Frances Nixon, 1973. PRECAUTIONS: Only the ONE person using each bath should prepare it and drain it. For at least 30 minutes after taking the bath, stay away from, and even out of sight of, other people. (Your greatly expanded Aura energy-field during that time could disrupt other people's fields.) Two hours after the bath, eat at least 8 ounces of yogurt containing ACTIVE Yogurt Cultures. (The bath may kill FRIENDLY bacteria also.) Better yet, take a 2-Billion-bacteria "" Acidophilus"" capsule, which is also an EXCELLENT DAILY REMEDY AGAINST THE EFFECTS OF "" A.I.D.S."" (because it kills all kinds of harmful bacteria in the digestive tract, taking a big load off the remaining immune system). [Because this external bath can kill IN-ternal bacteria, it may also be a CURE for "" Lyme disease"" .] Do NOT take this bath within a few hundred miles of a thunder storm, within 3 days of a full moon, nor during "" Major"" or "" Minor Periods"" as listed in the "" Solunar Tables"" published bimonthly in "" Field & Stream"" Magazine, (because of the measurable disruptive ambient environmental energy-fields present at those times). Do NOT take this bath more than four times per year. (5) MISCELLANEOUS NATURAL ANTI-CANCER REMEDIES: For skin cancer, apply STABILIZED Aloe Vera Jel to the affected skin twice daily, and take 2 to 4 tablespoons per day of STABILIZED Aloe Vera Juice internally, for about 2 months. D.M.S.O. (Dimethyl Sulfoxide) causes cancer cells to perform NORMAL cell functions. ALMONDS (UN-blanched, UN-roasted) CONTAIN LAETRILE. To help prevent cancer, eat several almonds every day. To help cure cancer, eat several OUNCES of almonds per day. [NEVER take large concentrated doses of Laetrile orally. IT WILL KILL YOU! Take it INTRAVENOUSLY ONLY. (Cancer cells contain a certain enzyme which converts Laetrile into cyanide, which then kills the cell. This enzyme is ALSO present in the digestive system.)] ANTI-OXIDANTS are FREE-RADICAL SCAVENGERS, and include Vitamin E, Selenium (200 mcg. per day is safe for most people.), Chromium (up to 100 mcg. per day), Vitamin A (25,000 IU per day is safe for most people.), Superoxide Dismutase (up to 4,000,000 Units per day), Vitamin C (up to 3000 mg. per day), and BHT (Butylated Hydroxy- toluene), [1 to 4 capsules of BHT every night at bedtime will also MAKE ONE IMMUNE AGAINST HERPES (BOTH types), suppress herpes symptoms if one already has herpes, prevent spreading herpes to other people, but will not cure herpes. BHT MIGHT ALSO DO THESE THINGS AGAINST "" A.I.D.S."" , which is really a form of cancer similar to leukemia.] (See the book "" Life Extension"" , by Durk Pearson and Sandy Shaw.) HYDROGEN-PEROXIDE. Dilute twelve(12) drops of 3% hydrogen-peroxide in a glass of pure water (preferably DISTILLED) and drink it. Do this once or twice per day, hours before or after eating or drinking anything else. Apply 3% hydrogen-peroxide directly to skin cancers several times per day. Use hydrogen-peroxide ONLY if you are taking a good daily dose of some of the various anti-oxidants described above. VITAMIN & MINERAL SUPPLEMENTS are more effective, and much less expensive, when COMBINED together in MEGA doses into SINGLE tablets made from NATURAL sources. Cancer cells can NOT live in a strong (100,000 Maxwell) NORTH MAGNETIC FIELD, especially if it is pulsating on and off. [A strong south magnetic field is an aphrodisiac.] In my opinion, ALL types of ionizing- radiation treatments for cancer should be REPLACED with daily 30-minute doses of pulsating 100,000-Maxwell NORTH magnetic fields. Properly made and operated RADIONICS/PSIONICS MACHINES can both diagnose and cure all forms of cancer, as well as most other medical problems. Some Radionics/Psionics Machines can even take cross-sectional X-ray-like photos of cancer tumors, etc., with-OUT X-rays! INTERFERON tablets. TAHEEBO TEA, (Lapacho). HOMEOPATHY can cure cancer, and many other medical problems (even drug addiction!). 50 mg. per day of CHELATED ZINC can help prevent or cure prostate trouble. This list is NOT exhaustive. The above NATURAL Remedies can CURE both diagnosed AND UN- DIAGNOSED cancers, as well as PREVENT them, and also prevent and cure many other medical problems including heart- diseases. They are NOT too simple and inexpensive to work effectively. Besides acting on a person biologically and chemically, these remedies, especially The 7-Day Fast and The Grape Diet, send a strong message to one's subconscious mind, PROGRAMMING it to CURE the cancer. In my opinion, if a person finds out that s/he has cancer, then s/he should promptly try at least the first 4 remedies described above, in sequence (starting with The 7-Day Fast), BEFORE resorting to the UN-natural and expensive mutilations and agonies [POISON, BURN, and MUTILATE!] of orthodox cancer treatment [organi$ed-CRIME!].

"In article < 19392@pitt.UUCP> geb@cs.pitt.edu (Gordon Banks) writes: All true. And all good points. Well, making a career out of it is a bit strong. I still believe that doing your own research is very, very necessary. I would not have progressed as much as I have today, unless I had spent the many hours in Stanford's Med Library as I have done. And 5 years ago, it was clear that there was no medicine that would help me. So should I have stopped searching. Thank goodness I didn't. Now I found that there is indeed medicine that helps me. I think that what you've said is kind of idealistic. That you would go to one doctor, get a diagnosis, maybe get a second opinion, and then move on with your life. Just as an example... having seen 6 of the top specialists in this field in the country, I have received 6 different diagnoses. These are the top names, the ones that people come to from all over the country. I have HAD to sort all of this out myself. Going to a support group (and in fact, HEADING that support group) was helpful for a while, but after a point, I found it very unproductive. It was much more productive to do library research, make phone calls and put together the pieces of the puzzle myself. A recent movie, Lorenzo's Oil, offers a perfect example of what I'm talking about. If you haven't seen it, you should. It's not a put down of doctor's and neither is what I'm saying. Doctors are only human and can only do so much. But there are those of us out here who are intelligent and able to sometimes find a missing piece of the puzzle that might have otherwise gone unnoticed. I guess I'm biased because dizziness is one of those weird things that is still so unknown. If I had a broken arm, or a weak heart, or failing kidneys, I might not have the same opinion. That's because those things are much more tangible and have much more concise definitions and treatments. With dizziness, you just have to decide to live with it or decide to live with it while trying to find your way out of it. I have chosen the latter. Linda lindae@netcom.netcom.com",0,0,1,medical

If you cann't ftp, send me mail, and I'll uuencode and mail them to you (they're pretty big...) ============== Using a PC's keyboard on your workstation / compatibility issues Mini outline: 1. Spoofing a keyboard over the serial port 2. X terminals 3. NeXT 4. Silicon Graphics 5. IBM RS/6000 6. Other stuff 1. Spoofing a keyboard over the serial port If you've got a proprietary computer which uses its own keyboard (Sun, HP, DEC, etc.) then you're going to have a hard time finding a vendor to sell you a compatible keyboard. If your workstation runs the X window system, you're in luck. You can buy a cheap used PC, hook your expensive keyboard up to it, and run a serial cable to your workstation. Then, run a program on the workstation to read the serial port and generate fake X keyboard events. The two main programs I've found to do this are KT and A2X. a2x is a sophisticated program, capable of controlling the mouse, and even moving among widgets on the screen. It requires a server extension (XTEST, DEC-XTRAP, or XTestExtension1). To find out if your server can do this, run 'xdpyinfo' and see if any of these strings appear in the extensions list. If your server doesn't have this, you may want to investigate compiling X11R5, patchlevel 18 or later, or bugging your vendor. kt is a simpler program, which should work with unextended X servers. Another program called xsendevent also exists, but I haven't seen it. Both a2x and kt are available via anonymous ftp from soda.berkeley.edu. 2. X terminals Also, a number of X terminals (NCD, Tektronics, to name a few) use PC-compatible keyboards. If you have an X terminal, you may be all set. Try it out with a normal PC keyboard before you go through the trouble of buying an alternative keyboard. Also, some X terminals add extra buttons -- you may need to keep your original keyboard around for the once-in-a-blue-moon that you have to hit the Setup key. 3. NeXT NeXT had announced that new NeXT machines will use the Apple Desktop Bus, meaning any Mac keyboard will work. Then, they announced they were cancelling their hardware production. If you want any kind of upgrade for an older NeXT, do it now! 4. Silicon Graphics Silicon Graphics has announced that their newer machines (Indigo^2 and beyond) will use standard PC-compatible keyboards and mice. I don't believe this also applies to the Power Series machines. It's not possible to upgrade an older SGI to use PC keyboards, except by upgrading the entire machine. Contact your SGI sales rep for more details. 5. IBM RS/6000 IBM RS/6000 keyboards are actually similar to normal PC keyboards. || Unfortunately, you cann't just plug one in. You need two things: a || cable converter to go from the large PC keyboard connector to the || smaller PS/2 style DIN-6, and a new device driver for AIX. Believe || it or not, IBM wrote this device driver recently, I used it, and it || works. However, they don't want me to redistribute it. I've been || told Judy Hume (512) 823-6337 is a potential contact. If you learn || anything new, please send me e-mail. || 6. Other stuff Some vendors here (notably: Health Care Keyboard Co. and AccuCorp) support some odd keyboard types, and may be responsive to your queries regarding supporting your own weird computer. If you can get sufficient documention about how your keyboard works (either from the vendor, or with a storage oscilloscope), you may be in luck. Contact the companies for more details. Apple Adjustable Keyboard Apple Computer, Inc. Sales offices all over the place. Availability: February, 1993 Price: $219 Supports: Mac only Apple has recently announced their new split-design keyboard. The keyboard has one section for each hand, and the sections rotate backward on a hinge. The sections do not tilt upward. The keys are arranged in a normal QWERTY fashion. The main foldable keyboard resembles a normal Apple Keyboard. A separate keypad contains all the extended key functions. The keyboard also comes with matching wrist rests, which are not directly attachable to the keyboard. As soon as soda comes back up, I'll have a detailed blurb from TidBITS available there. FlexPro Keyboard Key Tronic Phone: 800-262-6006 Possible contact: Denise Razzeto, 509-927-5299 Sold by many clone vendors and PC shops Availability: Spring, 1993 (?) Price: $489 (?) Supports: PC only (highly likely) Keytronic apparently showed a prototype keyboard at Comdex. It's another split-design. One thumb-wheel controls the tilt of both the left and right-hand sides of the main alphanumeric section. The arrow keys and keypad resemble a normal 101-key PC keyboard. Keytronic makes standard PC keyboards, also, so this product will probably be sold through their standard distribution channels. DragonDictate-30K (and numerous other Dragon products) Dragon Systems, Inc. 320 Nevada Street Newton, MA 02160 Phone: 800-TALK-TYP or 617-965-5200 Fax: 617-527-0372 Shipping: Now.

The program is called a2x, and is available via anonymous ftp: soda.berkeley.edu:pub/typing-injury/a2x.tar.Z export.lcs.mit.edu:contrib/a2x.tar.Z (most current) If you want to use your Dragon product with X windows, you may want to ask for Peter Cohen, an salesman at Dragon who knows more about this sort of thing. Dragon Systems sells a number of voice recognition products. Most (if not all) of them seem to run on PC's and compatibles (including PS/2's and other MicroChannel boxes). They sell you a hardware board and software which sits in front of a number of popular word processors and spreadsheets. Each user `trains' the system to their voice, and there are provisions to correct the system when it makes mistakes, on the fly. Multiple people can use it, but you have to load a different personality file for each person. You still get the use of your normal keyboard, too. On the DragonDictate-30K you need to pause 1/10th sec between words. Dragon claims typical input speeds of 30-40 words per minute. I don't have specs on the DragonWriter 1000. The DragonDictate-30K can recognize 30,000 words at a time. The DragonWriter 1000 can recognize (you guessed it) 1000 words at a time. Dragon's technology is also part of the following products (about which I have no other info): Microsoft Windows Sound System (Voice Pilot) IBM VoiceType Voice Navigator II (by Articulate Systems -- for Macintosh) EMStation (by Lanier Voice Products -- "" emergency medical workstation&quot ;) The Bat old phone number: 504-336-0033 current phone number: 504-766-8082 Infogrip, Inc. 812 North Blvd. Baton Rouge, Louisiana 70802, U.S.A.

"" Big backlog"" -- could take 3+ months. Price: $2000/unit (1 unit == 2 pods). (new price!) || Each hand has its own "" pod"" . Each of the four main fingers has five switches each: forward, back, left, right, and down. The thumbs have a number of switches. Despite appearances, the key layout resembles QWERTY, and is reported to be no big deal to adapt to. The idea is that your hands never have to move to use the keyboard. The whole pod tilts in its base, to act as a mouse.

The hardware design is relatively easy for the company to re-configure. Price: $690, including one system "" personality module"" . || The idea is that one keyboard works with everything. You purchase "" compatibility modules"" , a new cord, and possibly new keycaps, and then you can move your one keyboard around among different machines. It's a three-piece folding keyboard. The layout resembles the standard 101-key keyboard, except sliced into three sections. Each section is on a "" custom telescoping universal mount."" Each section independently adjusts to an infinite number of positions allowing each individual to type in a natural posture. You can rearrange the three sections, too (have the keypad in the middle if you want). Each section is otherwise normal-shaped (i.e.: you put all three sections flat, and you have what looks like a normal 101-key keyboard). Kinesis Ergonomic Keyboard 206-455-9220 206-455-9233 (fax) Kinesis Corporation 15245 Pacific Highway South, Seattle, Washington 98188, U.S.A. Shirley Lunde (VP Marketing -- contact) Shipping: Now. Supports: PC. Mac and Sun Sparc in the works. Price: $690. Volume discounts available. The $690 includes one foot pedal, one set of adhesive wrist pads, and a TypingTutor program. An additional foot pedal and other accessories are extra. The layout has a large blank space in the middle, even though the keyboard is about the size of a normal PC keyboard -- slightly smaller. Each hand has its own set of keys, laid out to minimize finger travel. Thumb buttons handle many major functions (enter, backspace, etc.). You can remap the keyboard in firmware (very nice when software willn't allow the reconfig). Foot pedals are also available, and can be mapped to any key on the keyboard (shift, control, whatever).

Box 66 Christiansburg, VA 24073, U.S.A. 703-961-3576 (Pete Rosenquist -- Sales) 703-961-2001 (Larry Langley -- President) Shipping: Now. Supports: PC, Mac, IBM 3270, Sun Sparc, and TeleVideo 935 and 955. Cost: $495 + shipping. Doesn't use conventional push-keys. Soft rubber keys, which rock forward and backward (each key has three states), make chords for typing keys. Learning time is estimated to be 2-3 hours, for getting started, and maybe two weeks to get used to it. Currently, the thumbs don't do anything, although a thumb-trackball is in the works. The company claims it takes about a week of work to support a new computer. They will be happy to adapt their keyboard to your computer, if possible. Twiddler 516-474-4405, or 800-638-2352 Handykey 141 Mt. Sinai Ave. Mt. Sinai, NY 11766 Chris George (President) Shipping: now. Price: $199. Supports: PC only. Mac and X Windows in the works. The Twiddler is both a keyboard and a mouse, and it fits in one hand. You type via finger chords. Shift, control, etc. are thumb buttons. When in "" mouse"" mode, tilting the Twiddler moves the mouse, and mouse buttons are on your fingers. The cabling leaves your normal keyboard available, also. Most applications work, and Windows works fine. DESQview has trouble. GEOWorks also has trouble -- mouse works, keyboard doesn't. Braille 'n Speak 301-879-4944 Blazie Engineering 3660 Mill Green Rd. Street, Md 21154, U.S.A. (information provided by Doug Martin < martin@nosc.mil> ) The Braille N Speak uses any of several Braille codes for entering information: Grade I, Grade II, or computer Braille. Basically, letters a-j are combinations of dots 1, 2, 4, and 5. Letters k-t are the same combinations as a-j with dot 3 added. Letters u, v, x, y, and z are like a-e with dots 3 and 6 added. (w is unique because Louis Braille didn't have a w in the French alphabet.) The Tony! Ergonomic KeySystem 415-969-8669 Tony Hodges The Tony!

When it ships, if it's cheaper, you pay the cheaper price. If it's more expensive, you still pay $625) The Tony! should allow separate positioning of every key, to allow the keyboard to be personally customized. A thumb-operated mouse will also be available.

If you have questions, you want to send mail to Richard, not me. -- Dan Software Tools to help with RSI ------------------------------- This file describes tools, primarily software, to help prevent or manage RSI. This version now includes information on such diverse tools as calendar programs and digital watches... Please let me know if you know any other tools, or if you have information or opinions on these ones, and I will update this FAQ. I am especially interested in getting reviews of these products from people who have evaluated them or are using them. Richard Donkin Internet mail: richardd@hoskyns.co.uk Tel: +44 71 814 5708 (direct) Fax: +44 71 251 2853 Changes in this version: Added information on StressFree, another typing management tool for Windows. TYPING MANAGEMENT TOOLS: these aim to help you manage your keyboard use, by warning you to take a break every so often. The better ones also include advice on exercises, posture and workstation setup. Some use sound hardware to warn of a break, others use beeps or screen messages. Often, RSI appears only after many years of typing, and the pain has a delayed action in the short term too: frequently you can be typing all day with little problem and the pain gets worse in the evening. These tools act as an early warning system: by listening to their warnings and taking breaks with exercises, you don't have to wait for your body to give you a more serious and painful warning - that is, getting RSI. Tool: At Your Service (commercial software) Available from: Bright Star Tel: +1 (206) 451 3697 Platforms: Mac (System 6.0.4), Windows Description: Provides calendar, keyboard watch, email watch, and system info. Warns when to take a break (configurable). Has a few recommendations on posture, and exercises. Sound-oriented, will probably work best with sound card (PC) or with microphone (Mac). Should be possible to record your own messages to warn of break. Tool: AudioPort (sound card and software) Available from: Media Vision Tel: +1 (510) 226 2563 Platforms: PC Description: A sound card to plug into your PC parallel port. Includes 'At Your Service'. Tool: Computer Health Break (commercial software) Available from: Escape Ergonomics, Inc 1111 W. El Camino Real Suite 109 Mailstop 403 Sunnyvale, CA Tel: +1 (408) 730 8410 Platforms: DOS Description: Aimed at preventing RSI, this program warns you to take breaks after a configurable interval, based on clock time, or after a set number of keystrokes -- whichever is earlier. It gives you 3 exercises to do each time, randomly selected from a set of 70. Exercises are apparently tuned to the type of work you do - data entry, word processing, information processing. Exercises are illustrated and include quite a lot of text on how to do the exercise and on what exactly the exercise does. CHB includes hypertext information on RSI that you can use to learn more about RSI and how to prevent it. Other information on non-RSI topics can be plugged into this hypertext viewer. A full glossary of medical terms and jargon is included. CHB can be run in a DOS box under Windows, but does not then warn you when to take a break; it does not therefore appear useful when used with Windows. Cost: $79.95; quantity discounts, site licenses. Comments: The keystroke-counting approach looks good: it seems better to measure the activity that is causing you problems than to measure clock time or even typing time. The marketing stuff is very good and includes some summaries of research papers, as well as lots of arguments you can use to get your company to pay up for RSI management tools. Tool: EyerCise (commercial software) Available from: RAN Enterprises One Woodland Park Dr. Haverhill, MA 01830, US Tel: 800-451-4487 (US only) Platforms: Windows (3.0/3.1), OS/2 PM (1.3/2.0) [Not DOS] Description: Aimed at preventing RSI and eye strain, this program warns you to take breaks after a configurable interval (or at fixed times). Optionally displays descriptions and pictures of exercises - pictures are animated and program beeps you to help you do exercises at the correct rate. Includes 19 stretches and 4 visual training exercises, can configure which are included and how many repetitions you do - breaks last from 3 to 7 minutes. Also includes online help on workplace ergonomics. Quote from their literature: "" EyerCise is a Windows program that breaks up your day with periodic sets of stretches and visual training exercises. The stretches work all parts of your body, relieving tension and helping to prevent Repetitive Strain Injury. The visual training exercises will improve your peripheral vision and help to relieve eye strain. Together these help you to become more relaxed and productive."" "" The package includes the book _Computers & Visual Stress_ by Edward C. Godnig, O.D. and John S. Hacunda, which describes the ergonomic setup for a computer workstation and provides procedures and exercises to promote healthy and efficient computer use. Cost: $69.95 including shipping and handling, quantity discounts for resellers. Free demo ($5 outside US). Comments: I have a copy of this, and it works as advertised: I would say it is better for RSI prevention than RSI management, because it does not allow breaks at periods less than 30 minutes. Also, it interrupts you based on clock time rather than typing time, which is not so helpful unless you use the keyboard all day. Worked OK on Windows 3.0 though it did occasionally crash with a UAE - not sure why. Also refused to work with the space bar on one PC, and has one window without window controls. Very usable though, and does not require any sound hardware. Tool: Lifeguard (commercial software) Available from: Visionary Software P.O. Box 69447 Portland, OR 97201, US Tel: +1 (503) 246-6200 Platforms: Mac, DOS (Windows version underway) Description: Aimed at preventing RSI. Warns you to take a break with dialog box and sound. Includes a list of exercises to do during breaks, and information on configuring your workstation in an ergonomic manner. Price: $59; quantity discounts and site licenses. The DOS product is bought in from another company, apparently; not sure how equivalent this is to the Mac version. The Mac version got a good review in Desktop Publisher Magazine (Feb 1991). Good marketing stuff with useful 2-page summaries of RSI problems and solutions, with references. Tool: StressFree (commercial software, free usable demo) Available from: LifeTime Software P.O. Box 87522 Houston Texas 77287-7522, US Tel: 800-947-2178 (US only) Fax: +1 (713) 474-2067 Mail: 70412.727@compuserve.com Demo (working program but reduced functions) available from: Compuserve: Windows Advanced Forum, New Uploads section, or Health and Fitness Forum, Issues At Work section. Anon FTP: ftp.cica.indiana.edu (and mirroring sites) Platforms: Windows (3.0/3.1) (Mac and DOS versions underway) Description: Aimed at preventing RSI, this program warns you to take breaks after a configurable interval (or at fixed times). Displays descriptions and pictures of exercises - pictures are animated and program paces you to help you do exercises at the correct rate. Quite a few exercises, can configure which ones are included to some extent. Online help. Version 2.0 is out soon, Mac and DOS versions will be based on this. Cost: $29.95 if support via CompuServe or Internet, otherwise $39.95. Site license for 3 or more copies is $20.00 each. (NOTE: prices may have gone up for V2.0). Comments: I have had a play with this, and it works OK. Its user interface design is much better in 2.0, though still a bit unusual. expensive tool around and it does the job. It is also the only tool with a redistributable demo, so if you do get the demo, post it on your local bulletin boards, FTP servers and Bitnet servers! Does not include general info on RSI and ergonomics, but it does have the ability to step backward in the exercise sequence, which is good for repeating the most helpful exercises. Tool: Typewatch (freeware), version 3.8 (October 1992) Available from: Email to richardd@hoskyns.co.uk Anonymous ftp: soda.berkeley.edu:pub/typing-injury/typewatch.shar Platforms: UNIX (tested on SCO, SunOS, Mach; character and X Window mode) Description: This is a shell script that runs in the background and warns you to stop typing, based on how long you have been continuously typing. It does not provide exercises, but it does check that you really do take a break, and tells you when you can start typing again. Typewatch now tells you how many minutes you have been typing today, each time it warns you, which is useful so you know how much you *really* type. It also logs information to a file that you can analyse or simply print out. The warning message appears on your screen (in character mode), in a pop-up window (for X Windows), or as a Zephyr message (for those with Athena stuff). Tim Freeman < tsf@cs.cmu.edu> has put in a lot of bug fixes, extra features and support for X, Zephyr and Mach. Not formally supported, but email richardd@hoskyns.co.uk (for SCO, SunOS, character mode) or tsf@cs.cmu.edu (for Mach, X Window mode, Zephyr) if you have problems or want to give feedback. Tool: Various calendar / batch queue programs Available from: Various sources Platforms: Various Description: Any calendar/reminder program that warns you of an upcoming appointment can be turned into an ad hoc RSI management tool. Or, any batch queue submission program that lets you submit a program to run at a specific time to display a message to the screen. Using Windows as an example: create a Calendar file, and include this filename in your WIN.INI's 'load=' line so you get it on every startup of Windows. Suppose you want to have breaks every 30 minutes, starting from 9 am. Press F7 (Special Time...) to enter an appointment, enter 9:30, hit Enter, and type some text in saying what the break is for. Then press F5 to set an alarm on this entry, and repeat for the next appointment. By using Windows Recorder, you can record the keystrokes that set up breaks throughout a day in a .REC file. Put this file on your 'run=' line, as above, and you will then, with a single keypress, be able to set up your daily appointments with RSI exercises. The above method should be adaptable to most calendar programs. An example using batch jobs would be to submit a simple job that runs at 9:30 am and warns you to take a break; this will depend a lot on your operating system. While these approaches are not ideal, they are a good way of forcing yourself to take a break if you cann't get hold of a suitable RSI management tool. If you are techie enough you might want to write a version of Typewatch (see above) for your operating system, using batch jobs or whatever fits best. Tool: Digital watches with count-down timers Available from: Various sources, e.g. Casio BP-100. Description: Many digital watches have timers that count down from a settable number of minutes; they usually reset easily to that number, either manually or automatically. While these are a very basic tool, they are very useful if you are writing, reading, driving, or doing anything away from a computer which can still cause or aggravate RSI. The great advantage is that they remind you to break from whatever you are doing. Comments: My own experience was that cutting down a lot on my typing led to my writing a lot more, and still reading as much as ever, which actually aggravated the RSI in my right arm though the left arm improved. Getting a count-down timer watch has been very useful on some occasions where I write a lot in a day. I have tried an old fashioned hour-glass type egg timer, but these are not much good because they do not give an audible warning of the end of the time period! KEYBOARD REMAPPING TOOLS: these enable you to change your keyboard mapping so you can type one-handedly or with a different two-handed layout. One-handed typing tools may help, but be VERY careful about how you use them -- if you keep the same overall typing workload you are simply doubling your hand use for the hand that you use for typing, and may therefore make matters worse. Tool: hsh (public domain) Available from: Anonymous ftp: soda.berkeley.edu:pub/typing-injury/hsh.shar Platforms: UNIX (don't know which ones) Description: Allows one-handed typing and other general keyboard remappings. Only works through tty's (so, you can use it with a terminal or an xterm, but not most X programs). Tool: Dvorak keyboard tools (various) Available from: Anonymous ftp: soda.berkeley.edu:pub/typing-injury/xdvorak.c Also built into Windows 3.x. Description: The Dvorak keyboard apparently uses a more rational layout that involves more balanced hand use. It *may* help prevent RSI a bit, but you can also use it if you have RSI, since it will slow down your typing a *lot* :-) -- Dan Wallach "" One of the most attractive features of a Connection dwallach@cs.berkeley.edu Machine is the array of blinking lights on the faces Office#: 510-642-9585 of its cabinet."" -- CM Paris Ref.

"In article < lsj4gnINNl6c@saltillo.cs.utexas.edu> turpin@cs.utexas.edu (Russell Turpin) writes: As usual, you are missing the whole point, Russell, because you are not willing to even consider questionning your basic article of faith, which is that science is merely a matter of methodology and that the highest purpose of science is to avoid making mistakes. This is like saying that the most important aspect of business management is accurate bookkeeping. If science were no more than methodology and not making mistakes, it would be a poor thing indeed. What was the methodology of Darwin? What was the methodology of Einstein? What was, for that matter, the methodology of Jenner and Pasteur? In an earlier article, Russell Turpin writes: First of all, I think you are arguing against a straw man, because I don't think that anyone here is arguing that quackery, pseudo-science, homeopathy, chiropracty, and traditional Chinese medicine should be accepted as science. I, in particular, think the basic ideas of homeopathy and chiropracty seem extremely flaky. What some of us do believe, however, is that some of these things (including some of the flaky ideas) are deserving of serious scientific attention. If in fact it were true, as you have stated above, that those who do not use the currently fashionable methodology can have no idea what is effective and what is not, then science today would not exist. For all of current science is based on the past work of scientists whose methodology, by current standards, was seriously flawed. It is certainly true that as methodology improves, we need to re-examine those results derived in the past using less perfect methodologies. It is also true that the results obtained by people today who still rely on those early methodologies needs to be re-examined in a more rigorous fashion by those qualified to do so credibly. But to say that nobody who fails to do elaborate double-blind studies is capable of knowing their ass from a hole in the ground and to say that no ideas that come from outside the scientific establishment could possibly be worthy of serious investigation ... this truly marks one's attitude as doctrinaire, cultist. This attitude is not compatible with a belief in reason. -- In the arguments between behaviorists and cognitivists, psychology seems less like a science than a collection of competing religious sects. lady@uhunix.uhcc.hawaii.edu lady@uhunix.bitnet",0,0,1,medical

As soon as you possibly can. The difference of a day or two can mean the difference between a short recovery and a long, drawn-out ordeal. GO SEE A DOCTOR. Now, your garden-variety doctor may not necessarily be familiar with this sort of injury. Generally, any hospital with an occupational therapy clinic will offer specialists in these kinds of problems. DON'T WAIT, THOUGH. GO SEE A DOCTOR. The remainder of this information is paraphrased, without permission, from a wonderful report by New Zealand's Department of Labour (Occupational Safety and Health Service): "" Occupational Overuse Syndrome. Treatment and Rehabilitation: A Practitioner's Guide"" . First, a glossary (or, fancy names for how you shouldn't have your hands): (note: you're likely to hear these terms from doctors and keyboard vendors :) RSI: Repetitive Strain Injury - a general term for many kinds of injuries OOS: Occupational Overuse Syndrome -- synonym for RSI CTD: Cumulative Trauma Disorder -- another synonym for RSI WRULD: Work-Related Upper Limb Disorders -- yet another synonym for RSI CTS: Carpal Tunnel Syndrome (see below) Hyperextension: Marked bending at a joint. Pronation: Turning the palm down. Wrist extension: Bending the wrist up. Supination: Turning the palm up. Wrist flexion: Bending the wrist down. Pinch grip: The grip used for a pencil. Ulnar deviation: Bending the wrist towards the little finger. Power grip: The grip used for a hammer. Radial Deviation: Bending the wrist toward the thumb. Abduction: Moving away from the body. Overspanning: Opening the fingers out wide. Now then, problems come in two main types: Local conditions and diffuse conditions. Local problems are what you'd expect: specific muscles, tendons, tendon sheaths, nerves, etc. being inflamed or otherwise hurt. Diffuse conditions, often mistaken for local problems, can involve muscle discomfort, pain, burning and/or tingling; with identifiable areas of tenderness in muscles, although they're not necessarily "" the problem.&quot ; --- Why does Occupational Overuse Syndrome occur? Here's the theory. Normally, your muscles and tendons get blood through capillaries which pass among the muscle fibers. When you tense a muscle, you restrict the blood flow. By the time you're exerting 50% of your full power, you're completely restricting your blood flow. Without fresh blood, your muscles use stored energy until they run out, then they switch to anaerobic (without oxygen) metabolism, which generates nasty by-products like lactic acid, which cause pain. Once one muscle hurts, all its neighbors tense up, perhaps to relieve the load. This makes sense for your normal sort of injury, but it only makes things worse with repetitive motion. More tension means less blood flow, and the cycle continues. Another by-product of the lack of blood flow is tingling and numbness from your nerves. They need blood too. Anyway, when you're typing too much, you're never really giving a change for the blood to get back where it belongs, because your muscles never relax enough to let the blood through. Stress, poor posture, and poor ergonomics, only make things worse. --- Specific injuries you may have heard of: (note: most injuries come in two flavors: acute and chronic. Acute injuries are severely painful and noticable. Chronic conditions have less pronounced symptoms but are every bit as real.) Tenosynovitis -- an inflamation of the tendon sheath. Chronic tenosynovitis occurs when the repetitive activity is mild or intermittent: not enough to cause acute inflamation, but enough to exceed the tendon sheath's ability to lubricate the tendon. As a result, the tendon sheath thickens, gets inflamed, and you've got your problem. Tendonitis -- an inflammation of a tendon. Repeated tensing of a tendon can cause inflamation. Eventually, the fibers of the tendon start separating, and can even break, leaving behind debris which induces more friction, more swelling, and more pain. "" Sub-acute"" tendonitis is more common, which entails a dull ache over the wrist and forearm, some tenderness, and it gets worse with repetitive activity. Carpal Tunnel Syndrome -- the nerves that run through your wrist into your fingers get trapped by the inflamed muscles around them. Symptoms include feeling "" pins and needles"" , tingling, numbness, and even loss of sensation. CTS is often confused for a diffuse condition. Adverse Mechanical Tension -- also known as 'neural tension', this is where the nerves running down to your arm have become contracted and possibly compressed as a result of muscle spasms in the shoulders and elsewhere. AMT can often misdiagnosed as or associated with one of the other OOS disorders. It is largely reversible and can be treated with physiotherapy (brachial plexus stretches and trigger point therapy). Others: for just about every part of your body, there's a fancy name for a way to injure it. By now, you should be getting an idea of how OOS conditions occur and why. Just be careful: many inexperienced doctors misdiagnose problems as Carpal Tunnel Syndrome, when in reality, you may have a completely different problem. Always get a second opinion before somebody does something drastic to you (like surgery). ==4== Typing posture, ergonomics, prevention, treatment The most important element of both prevention and recovery is to reduce tension in the muscles and tendons. This requires learning how to relax. If you're under a load of stress, this is doubly important. Tune out the world and breath deep and regular. Relaxing should become a guiding principle in your work: every three minutes take a three second break. EVERY THREE MINUTES, TAKE A THREE SECOND BREAK. Really, do it every three minutes. It's also helpful to work in comfortable surroundings, calm down, and relax. If you cann't sleep, you really need to focus on this. Rest, sleep, and relaxation are really a big deal. There are all kinds of other treatments, of course. Drugs can reduce inflamation and pain. Custom-molded splints can forcefully prevent bad posture. Surgery can fix some problems. Exercise can help strengthen your muscles. Regular stretching can help prevent injury. Good posture and a good ergonomic workspace promote reduced tension. Ice or hot-cold contrast baths also reduce swelling. Only your doctor can say what's best for you. --- Posture -- here are some basic guidelines. [I so liked the way this was written in the New Zealand book that I'm lifting it almost verbatim from Appendix 10. -- dwallach] . Let your shoulders relax. . Let your elbows swing free. . Keep your wrists straight. . Pull your chin in to look down - don't flop your head forward. . Keep the hollow in the base of your spine. . Try leaning back in the chair. . Don't slouch or slump forward. . Alter your posture from time to time. . Every 20 minutes, get up and bend your spine backward. Set the seat height, first. Your feet should be flat on the floor. There should be no undue pressure on the underside of your thighs near the knees, and your thighs should not slope too much. Now, draw yourself up to your desk and see that its height is comfortable to work at. If you are short, this may be impossible. The beest remedy is to raise the seat height and prevent your legs from dangling by using a footrest. Now, adjust the backrest height so that your buttocks fit into the space between the backrest and the seat pan. The backrest should support you in the hollow of your back, so adjust its tilt to give firm support in this area. If you operate a keyboard, you will be able to spend more time leaning back, so experiment with a chair with a taller backrest, if available. [Now, I diverge a little from the text] A good chair makes a big difference. If you don't like your chair, go find a better one. You really want adjustments for height, back angle, back height, and maybe even seat tilt. Most arm rests seem to get in the way, although some more expensive chairs have height adjustable arm rests which you can also rotate out of the way. You should find a good store and play with all these chairs -- pick one that's right for you. In the San Francisco Bay Area, I highly recommend "" Just Chairs."" The name says it all. --- Keyboard drawers, wrist pads, and keyboard replacements: There is a fair amount of controvery on how to get this right. For some people, wrist pads seem to work wonders. However, with good posture, you shouldn't be resting your wrists on anything -- you would prefer your keyboard to be "" right there"" . If you drop your arms at your side and then lift your hands up at the elbow, you want your keyboard under your hands when your elbows are at about 90 degrees. Of course, you want to avoid pronation, wrist extension, and ulnar deviation at all costs. Wrist pads may or may not help at this. You should get somebody else to come and look at how you work: how you sit, how you type, and how you relax. It's often easier for somebody else to notice your hunched shoulders or deviated hands. Some argue that the normal, flat keyboard is antiquated and poorly designed. A number of replacements are available, on the market, today. Check out the accompanying typing-injury-faq/keyboards for much detail. ==5== Requests for more info Clearly, the above information is incomplete. The typing-injury archive is incomplete. There's always more information out there. If you'd like to submit something, please send me mail, and I'll gladly throw it in. If you'd like to maintain a list of products or vendors, that would be wonderful! I'd love somebody to make a list of chair/desk vendors. I'd love somebody to make a list of doctors. I'd love somebody to edit the above sections, looking for places where I've obviously goofed. ==6== References I completely rewrote the information section here, using a wonderful guide produced in New Zealand by their Occupational Safety & Health Service, a service of their Department of Labour.

I fully agree with you that there is a big distinction between the *process* of science and the end result. As an end result of science, one wants to get results that are objectively verifiable. But there is nothing objective about the *process* of science. If good empirical research were done and showed that there is some merit to homeopathic remedies, this would certainly be valuable information. But it would still not mean that homeopathy qualifies as a science. This is where you and I disagree with Turpin. In order to have science, one must have a theoretical structure that makes sense, not a mere collection of empirically validated random hypotheses. Experiment and empirical studies are an important part of science, but they are merely the culmination of scientific research. The most important part of true scientific methodology is SCIENTIFIC THINKING. Without this, one does not have any hypotheses worth testing. (No, hypotheses do not just leap out at you after you look at enough data. Nor do they simply come to you in a flash one day while you're shaving or looking out the window. At least not unless you've done a lot of really good thinking beforehand.) The difference between a Nobel Prize level scientist and a mediocre scientist does not lie in the quality of their empirical methodology. It depends on the quality of their THINKING. It really bothers me that so many graduate students seem to believe that they are doing science merely because they are conducting empirical studies. And it bothers me even more that there are many fields, such as certain parts of psychology, where there seems to be no thinking at all, but mere studies testing ad hoc hypotheses. And I'm especially offended by Russell Turpin's repeated assertion that science amounts to nothing more than avoiding mistakes. Simply avoiding mistakes doesn't get you anywhere. -- In the arguments between behaviorists and cognitivists, psychology seems less like a science than a collection of competing religious sects. lady@uhunix.uhcc.hawaii.edu lady@uhunix.bitnet",0,0,1,medical

"I am posting to this group in hopes of finding someone out there in network newsland who has heard of something similar to what I am going to describe here. I have a fourteen year old daugter who experienced a seizure on November 3, 1992 at 6:45AM after eating Kellog's Frosted Flakes. She is perfectly healthy, had never experienced anything like this before, and there is no history of seizures in either side of the family. All the tests (EEG, MRI, EKG) came out negative so the decision was made to do nothing and just wait to see if it happened again. Well, we were going along fine and the other morning, April 5, she had a bowl of another Kellog's frosted kind of cereal, Fruit Loops (I am embarrassed to admit that I even bought that junk but every once in a while...) So I pour it in her bowl and think "" Oh, oh, this is the same kind of junk she was eating when she had that seizure."" Ten minutes later she had a full blown seizures. This was her first exposure to a sugar coated cereal since the last seizure. When I mentioned what she ate the first time as a possible reason for the seizure the neurologist basically negated that as an idea. Now after this second episode, so similar in nature to the first, even he is scratching his head. Once again her EEG looks normal which I understand can happen even when a person has a seizure. Once again we are waiting. I have been thinking that it would be good to get to as large a group as possible to see if anyone has any experience with this kind of thing. I know that members of the medical community are sometimes loathe to admit the importance that diet and foods play in our general health and well-being. Anyway, as you can guess, I am worried sick about this, and would appreciate any ideas anyone out there has. Sorry to be so wordy but I wanted to really get across what is going on here.

Many of the predecessors of Kekule's structure resemble the modern model more. I don't think "" extra-scientific"" is a very useful phrase in a discussion of the boundaries of science, except as a proposed definiens. Extra-rational is a better phrase. In fact, there are quite a number of well-known cases of extra-rational considerations driving science in a useful direction. For example, Pasteur discovered that racemic acid was a mixture of enantiomers (the origin of stereochemistry) partly because he liked a friend's crank theory of chemical action. The friend was wrong, but Pasteur's discovery stood. A prior investigator (Mitscherlich), looking at the same phenomenon, had missed a crucial detail; presumably because he lacked Pasteur's motivation to find something that distinguished racemic acid from tartaric (now we say: d-tartaric) acid. Again, Pasteur discovered the differential fermentation of enantiomers (tartaric acid again) not because of some rational conviction, but because he was trying to produce yeast that lived on l-tartaric acid. His notebooks contained fantasies of becoming the "" Newton of mirror-image life,"" which he never admitted publically. Perhaps the best example is the discovery that DNA carries genes. Avery started this work because of one of his students, and ardent Anglophile and Francophobe Canadian, defended Fred Griffiths' discoveries in mice. Most of Griffiths' critics were French, which decided the issue for the student. Avery told him to replicate Griffiths' work in vitro, which the student eventually did, whereupon Avery was convinced and started the research program which, in 15 or so years, produced the famous discovery (Avery, MacLeod, and McCarty, JEM 1944). -- Mark A.

"Here is a press release from the Natural Resources Defense Council. New Data Show About 100 Major U.S. Water Supplies Vulnerable To Milwaukee-Type Disease Outbreak To: National Desk, Environment Writer Contact: Erik Olson or Sarah Silver, 202-783-7800, both of the Natural Resources Defense Council WASHINGTON, April 14 -- Internal EPA data released today by the Natural Resources Defense Council reveals that about 100 large water systems -- serving cities from Boston to San Francisco -- do not filter to remove disease-carrying organisms leaving those communities potentially vulnerable to a disease outbreak similar to the one affecting Milwaukee. The EPA list is attached. "" These internal EPA documents reveal that the safety of water supplies in many American cities is threatened by inadequate pollution controls or filtration,"" said Erik Olson, a senior attorney with NRDC. "" Water contamination isn't just a problem in Bangladesh, it's also a problem in Bozeman and Boston."" "" As of June 29, 1993, about 100 large surface water systems on EPA's list probably will be breaking the law. The 1986 Safe Drinking Water Act requires all surface water systems to either filter their water or fully protect the rivers or lakes they use from pollution,"" Olson continued. Some systems are moving towards eventually implementing filtration systems but are expected to miss the law's deadline. Olson pointed out that the threat of contamination is already a reality in other cities. A 1991 survey of 66 U.S. surface water systems by water utility scientists found that 87 percent of raw water samples contained the Milwaukee organism cryptosporidium, and 81 percent contained a similar parasite called giardia. Adding to the level of concern, a General Accounting Office study released today by House Health and Environment Subcommittee Chairman Henry Waxman indicates serious deficiencies in the nation's system for conducting and following through on sanitary surveys of water systems. "" This new information raises a huge warning sign that millions of Americans can no longer simply turn on their taps and be assured that their water is safe to drink. We must immediately put into place programs to protect water sources from contamination and where this is not assured, filtration equipment must be installed to protect the public,"" Olson noted. "" The time has come for many of the nation's water utilities to stop dragging their feet and to aggressively protect their water from contamination; consumers are prepared to pay the modest costs needed to assure their water is safe to drink.""

For me there is a constant dynamic between my tendency to eat, which appears to be totally limitless, and the purely conscious desire to not put on too much weight.

I'm always afraid that this method will stop working someday, but usually I seem to be able to hold the weight gain in check. This is one reason I have a hard time accepting the notion of some metabolic derangement associated with cycle dieting (that results in long-term weight gain).

Not every wild flight of fancy serves (or can serve) in the appropriate relation to a hypothesis. It is somewhat interesting that when anyone is challanged to provide an example of this sort the *only* one they come up with is the one about Kekule. Surely, there must be others. But apparently this is regarded as an *extreme* example of a "" non-rational"" process in science whereby a successful hypothesis was proposed. But how non-rational is it?

Above, Lady seems concerned with the contrast between great science that makes big advances in our knowledge and mediocre science that makes smaller steps. In most of this thread, I have been concerned with the difference between what is science and what is not. Lee Lady is correct when she asserts that the difference between Einstein and the average post-doc physicist is the quality of their thought. But what is the difference between Einstein and a genius who would be a great scientist but whose great thoughts are scientifically screwy? (Some would give Velikovsky or Korzybski as examples. If you don't like these, choose your own.) I say it is the same as the difference between the mediocre physicist and the mediocre proponent of qi. Both Einstein and the mediocre physcists have disciplined their work from the cumulative knowledge of how previous researchers went wrong. Both Velikovsky and the mediocre proponent of qi have failed to do this. Let me approach this from a second direction. When one is asked to review a paper for a journal or conference, there are many kinds of criticism that one can make. One kind of criticism is that the work is just wrong or misinformed. Another kind of criticism is that the work, while technically correct, is either not important or not interesting. The first difference is the one that I have been pointing to. The second difference is the one that Lee Lady seems to be discussing. I have often pointed out that for homeopathy to be considered scientific, what is needed is a test of its theoretical claims, not just of some of its proposed remedies. Similarly, I suspect that traditional Chinese medicine has many remedies that work; what it lacks (as one example) is any experiment that tests the presence of qi. Certainly a "" theoretical structure that makes sense"" is the goal. In areas where we do not yet have this, I see nothing wrong with forming and testing smaller hypotheses. Let's face it: we cannot always wait for an Einstein to come along and make everything clear for us. Sometimes those of us who are not Einstein have to plug along and make small amounts of progress as best we can. Russell",0,0,1,medical

"In article < C5JE94.KrL@unx.sas.com> sasghm@theseus.unx.sas.com (Gary Merrill) writes: As has been noted before, there is the distinction between _motivation_ and _method_. No experimental result should be accepted unless it is described in sufficient detail to be replicated, and the replications do indeed reproduce the result. No theoretical argument should be accepted unless it is presented in sufficient detail to be followed, and reasonable, knowlegeable, people agree with the force of the logic. But people try experiments, and pursue arguments, for all sorts of crazy reasons. Irrational motivations are not just curiousities; they are a large part of the history of science. There are a couple of negative points to make here: 1) A theory of qi could, conceivably, become accepted without direct verification of the existence of qi. For example, quarks are an accepted part of the standard model of physics, with no direct verification. What would be needed would be a theory, based on qi, that predicted medical reality better than the alternatives. The central theoretical claim could lie forever beyond experiment, as long as there was a sufficient body of experimental data that the qi theory predicted better than any other. (I wouldn't hold my breath waiting for the triumph of qi, though. I don't think that there is even a coherent theory based on it, much less a theory that explains anything at all better than modern biology. And it is hard to imagine a qi theory that would not predict some way of rather directly verifying the existence of qi.) 2) Science has not historically progressed in any sort of rational experiment-data-theory sequence. Most experiments are carried out, and interpreted, in pre-existing theoretical frameworks. The theoretical controversies of the day determine which experiments get done. Overall, there is a huge messy affair of personal jealousies, crazy motivations, petty hatreds, and the like that determines which experiments, and which computations, get done. What keeps it going forward is the critical function of science: results don't count unless they can be replicated. The whole system is a sort of mechanism for generate-and-test. The generate part can be totally irrational, as long as the test part works properly. Pasteur could believe whatever he liked about chemical activity and crystals; but even Mitscherlich had to agree that racemic acid crystals were handed; that when you separate them by handedness, you get two chemicals that rotate polarized light in opposite directions; and the right-rotating version was indistinguishable from tartaric acid. Pasteur's irrational motivation had led to a replicable, and important, result. This is where Lysenko, creationists, etc. fail. They have usually not even produced coherent theories that predict much of anything. When their theories do predict, and are contradicted by experiment, they do not concede the point and modify their theories; rather they try to suppress the results (Lysenko) or try to divert attention to other evidence they think supports their position (creationists). -- Mark A.

"Avoiding mistakes is certainly highly desirable. However it is also widely acknowledged that perfectionism is inimicable to creativity. And in ordinary life, perfectionism carried beyond a certain point is indicative of a psychological disorder. In the extreme case, a perfectionist becomes so paralyzed by all the possible mistakes he might make that he is unable to even leave the house. In science, we want to discover as much truth about the world as possible and we also want to have as much certainty as possible about these discoveries. Usually there is some trade-off between these two desiderata --- the search for scope and the search for certainty. If 18th century mathematicians had demanded total rigor from Newton and Leibniz then there would probably be no calculus today, because neither of the two could explain calculus in a way that really made sense, since they lacked the concept of a limit. And in fact, because of the lack of a rigorous foundation, they made a number of errors in their use of calculus. It was only a hundred years later that Weistrass was able to give a solid grounding for the ideas of Newton and Leibniz. Nonetheless, what Newton and Leibniz did was undoubtedly science and mathematics gained a great deal more from the application of their important ideas than it lost through the mistakes they made.

According to these posters "" If it's not supported by carefully designed controlled studies then it's not science."" Taken to the extreme, I believe that the attitude that empirical studies are everything and ideas are nothing results in a complete stultification of science. For one thing, an insistence on an elaborate and expensive methodology results in a sort of scientific trade-unionism, where those outside the establishment and lacking institutional or corporate support have no chance to obtain a hearing. (I don't in the least believe that this is the intention of the arbiters of scientific methodology. Nonetheless, it is one of the results.) And although institutional science has certainly produced many wonderful results, I think it is a foolish arrogance for scientists to believe that no one outside the establishment --- and using less than perfect empirical methodology --- will ever come with anything worthwhile. Furthermore, the big bucks approach to science promotes what I think is one of the most significant errors in science: choosing to investigate questions because they can be readily handled by the currently fashionable methodology (or because one can readily get institutional or corporate sponsorship for them) instead of directing attention to those questions which seem to have fundamental significance. For instance, certain questions cannot be easily investigated with statistical methods because the relevant factors are not quantitative. (One could argue that this is the case for almost all questions in many areas of psychology. In my opinion, a perusal of many of the papers resulting from the attempt by psychologists to force these questions into a statistical framework gives the lie to Russell Turpin's assertion that current scientific methods "" avoid all known errors."" ) I think that asking the wrong question is probably the most fundamental error in science. (Ignoring potentially valuable ideas is one of the others.) And I think that scientific journals are full of all too many studies done with impeccable empirical methods but which are worthless because the wrong question was asked in the first place. -- In the arguments between behaviorists and cognitivists, psychology seems less like a science than a collection of competing religious sects. lady@uhunix.uhcc.hawaii.edu lady@uhunix.bitnet",0,0,1,medical

"A friend of mine has been diagnosed with Psoriatic Arthritis, as a result of trauma sustained in a car accident several years ago. The psoriasis is under control but the arthritis part of the illness is not. Ansaid (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory) worked pretty well for three years but isn't helping much now. My friend is now taking Meclomen (another NSAID) but this isn't helping control the pain at all. In the past two months my friend has also started taking Azulfadine along with the NSAID medicines, but the effects of the combined drugs aren't supposed to be realized for several months. As a result of the pain, my friend is having problems sleeping. Staying in one position too long is an ordeal. Another major contributor to pain is that tendonitis has now developed (left thumb and hand with numbness at the base of the palm; bottom of feet; shoulders and outer thighs). The tendonitis is quite painful yet my friend's doctor has not recommended any form of treatment to relieve it. The latest twist is that the doctor has dropped the anti-inflammatories and is now recommending Prednisone. The hope is that the Prednisone will relieve some of the pain from the tendonitis. My friend is a 41 year old male who feels like he's 80 (his words, not mine). If anyone is aware of any new treatments for Psoriatic Arthritis, alternative courses of action, support groups or literature on it, I would be extremely grateful if you could e-mail to me.

However the paragraphs above seem to repeat uncritically the standard Kuhn/Lakatos/Feyerabend view of "" progress"" and "" rationality"" in science. Since I've addressed these issues in this newsgroup in the not too distant past, I willn't go into them again now. What is wrong with the above observation is that it explicitly gives the impression (and you may not in fact hold this view) that the common (perhaps even the "" correct"" ) approach for a scientist to follow is to sit around having flights of fancy and scheming on the basis of his jealousies and petty hatreds. It further at least implicitly advances the position that sciences goes "" forward"" (and it is not clear what this means given the context in which it occurs) by generating in a completely non-rational and even random way a plethora of hypotheses and theories that are then weeded out via the "" critical function"" of science. (Though why this critical function should be less subject to the non-rational forces is a mystery. If experimental design, hypotheses creation, and theory construction are subject to jealousies and petty hatreds, then this must be equally true of the application of any "" critical function"" concerning replication. This is what leads one (ala Feyerabend) to an "" anything goes"" view.) True, the generation part *can* be totally irrational. But typically it is *not*. Anecdotes concerning instances where a hypothesis seems to have resulted in some way from a dream or from one's political views simply do not generalize well to the actual history of science. -- Gary H.

Both courses, Intensive Elementary Japanese and Intensive Intermediate Japanese, are ten week, ten credit courses each equivalent to one full year of Japanese language study. They begin June 7 and end August 13. The courses meet five days per week, five hours per day. There is a flat rate tuition charge of $1600 per course. Fellowships available for science and engineering students. Contact Steven Brener, Program Manager of the Japanese Science and Technology Management Program, at the University of Pittsburgh at the number or address below. ALL INTERESTED INDIVIDUALS ARE ENCOURAGED TO APPLY, THIS IS NOT LIMITED TO UNIVERSITY STUDENTS. ####################################################################### ################# New Program Announcement ######################## ####################################################################### JAPANESE SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY MANAGEMENT PROGRAM The Japanese Science and Technology Management Program (JSTMP) is a new program jointly developed by the University of Pittsbugh and Carnegie Mellon University. Students and professionals in the engineering and scientific communitites are encouraged to apply for classes commencing in June 1993 and January 1994. PROGRAM OBJECTIVES The program intends to promote technology transfer between Japan and the United States. It is also designed to let scientists, engineers, and managers experience how the Japanese proceed with technological development. This is facilitated by extended internships in Japanese research facilities and laboratories that provide participants with the opportunity to develop long-term professional relationships with their Japanese counterparts. PROGRAM DESIGN To fulfill the objectives of the program, participants will be required to develop advanced language capability and a deep understanding of Japan and its culture. Correspondingly, JSTMP consists of three major components: 1. TRAINING IN THE JAPANESE LANGUAGE Several Japanese language courses will be offered, including intensive courses designed to expedite language preparation for scientists and engineers in a relatively short time. 2. EDUCATION IN JAPANESE BUSINESS AND SOCIAL CULTURE A particular enphasis is placed on attaining a deep understanding of the cultural and educational basis of Japanese management approaches in manufacturing and information technology. Courses will be available in a variety of departments throughout both universities including Anthropology, Sociology, History, and Political Science. Moreover, seminars and colloquiums will be conducted. Further, a field trip to Japanese manufacturing or research facilities in the United States will be scheduled. 3. AN INTERNSHIP OR A STUDY MISSION IN JAPAN Upon completion of their language and cultural training at PITT and CMU, participants will have the opportunity to go to Japan and observe, and participate in the management of technology. Internships in Japan will generally run for one year; however, shorter ones are possible.

Maybe you missed it amidst the flurry of responses? Yet again, the use of this newsgroup is hampered by people not restricting their posts to matters they have substantial knowledge of. For cites on MSG, look up almost anything by John W. Olney, a toxicologist who has studied the effects of MSG on the brain and on development. It is undisputed in the literature that MSG is an excitotoxic food additive, and that its major constituent, glutamate is essentially the premierie neurotransmitter in the mammalian brain (humans included). Too much in the diet, and the system gets thrown off. Glutamate and aspartate, also an excitotoxin are necessary in small amounts, and are freely available in many foods, but the amounts added by industry are far above the amounts that would normally be encountered in a ny single food. By eating lots of junk food, packaged soups, and diet soft drinks, it is possible to jack your blood levels so high, that anyone with a sensitivity to these compounds will suffer numerous *real* physi9logical effects.

The crucial thing is not to sit around just having fantasies; they aren't of any use unless they make you do some experiments. I've known a lot of scientists whose fantasies lead them on to creative work; usually they willn't admit out loud what the fantasy was, prior to the consumption of a few beers. (Simple example: Warren Jelinek noticed an extremely heavy band on a DNA electrophoresis gel of human ALU fragments. He got very excited, hoping that he'd seen some essential part of the control mechanism for eukaryotic genes. This fantasy led him to sequence samples of the band and carry out binding assays. The result was a well-conserved, 400 or so bp, sequence that occurs about 500,000 times in the human genome. Unfortunately for Warren's fantasy, it turns out to be a transposon that is present in so many copies because it replicates itself and copies itself back into the genome. On the other hand, the characteristics of transposons were much elucidated; the necessity of a cellular reverse transcriptase was recognized; and the standard method of recognizing human DNA was created. Other species have different sets of transposons. Fortunately for me, Warren and I used to eat dinner at T.G.I. Fridays all the time.) I'm not sure that it's random. But there is no known rational mechanism for generating a rich set of interesting hypotheses. If you are really working in an unknown area, it is unlikely that you will have much sense of what might or might not be true; under those circumstances, the best thing to do is just follow whatever instincts you have. If they are wrong, you will find out soon enough; but at least, you will find out _something_. If you try to do experiments at random, with no prior conceptions at all in mind, you will probably get nowhere. Unfortunately, the critical function does sometimes become hostage to non-rational forces. Then we get varieties of pathological science: Lysenko, Mirsky's opposition to DNA-as-gene, cold fusion, and so forth. I don't agree that this follows. In fact, this is _exactly_ the point at which I disagree with Feyerabend. It is a most important part of the culture of science that one keeps one's jealousies out of the refereeing process. Failures there are aplenty, but, on the whole, things work out. Another point: there are a couple of senses of the phrase ``experimental design''. I'd say that the less rational part is in experimental _choice_, not design. Alexander Fleming (Proc. Royal Soc., 1922) chose to look for bacteriophage in his own mucus for strange reasons (Phage had previously been found in locust diarrhea; Fleming probably thought runny bottom, runny nose, what the hell, it's worth a try.) but his method of looking for phage was well-designed to detect anything phage-like; in fact, he found lysozyme. It is not clear to me what you mean by rational vs. irrational. Perhaps you can give a few examples of surprising experiments that were tried out for perfectly rational reasons, or interesting new theories that were first advanced from logical grounds. The main examples I can think of are from modern high-energy physics which is not typical of science as a whole. -- Mark A.

Look, people with a last Chen don't necessarily own a Chinese restaurant. I am not interested if you enjoy Chinese food or not. Exploiting my last name to discredit me on the issue is hitting below the belt. What I am interested in is the truth. Let me give you an excert from a recent FDA hearing: ``There is no evidence orally consumed glutamate has any effect on the brain,'' said Dr. Richard Wurtman of Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The anecdotal experiences of individuals is ``superstition, not science,'' he said. ``I don't think glutamate has made them sick.'' And Dr. Robert Kenney of George Washington University conducted an double blind test in 1980 showing that the 35 people who reacted to MSG also had similar reaction when they thought they had MSG but actually not. Although there are many contradicting personal stories told in this group, some of them might have been due to other causes. But because the anti MSG emotion runs so high, that some blame it for anything and everything. My purpose is to present a balance view on the issue, although I am probably 20-1 outnumbered.
