# Week-02 Regression
This is a week-02 Regression assignment where we focus on predictive modeling.

Review C02 model1 data generation and modeling notebooks covered in C02.Create two copies of your model-generating notebook and the model-fitting notebook. 

In the first copy, increase the amount of noise added to the data in your data-generating notebook. Run the model fitting notebook on this new data. Add a markdown cell at the end of the notebook that discusses how the resulting model fit results and how these compare to the original.

In the second copy, decrease the number of observations generated in the data-generating notebook. Run the model fitting notebook on this new data. Add a markdown cell at the end of the notebook that discusses how this resulting model fit results and how these compare to the original.
