This is a consolidation of the University of South Florida's Data Science Programming course assignments and learnings.
The course teaches the concepts of Data Science using Python.
The course starts by introducing data cleaning, data prep and measures to take when cleaning without introducing bias.
Which is a cruital part of Data Science. 

Gradually the course builds on top of itself by introducing various ML models used to predict data.
From Regression to Decision Trees to Neural Networks to AutoEncoders.
