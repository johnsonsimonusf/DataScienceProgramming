# Week-09 Convolutional Neural Network
This is a Week-09 Convolutional Neural Network learning.

We start with more ways to handle Deep Neural Networks using keras, and sklearn libraries.

Then dive into the concepts of Convolutional Neural Network.
In this notebook, we try to predict the category of a fruit image.
