# Week-08 Deep Neural Networks
This is a week-08 Deep Neural Networks where we focus on Deep Neural Networks and it's working.
We also utilize different approcahes like Random Search and Grid Search to find the best model when using Deep Neural Network.
We also intoduce Keras library. And try to compare the results of Neural Network and Deep Neural Network.


## MNIST machine learning exercise

In this exercise we will compare the performance of three different modeling approaches at predicting handwritten numbers. 
We use the MNIST data set: https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/27/MnistExamples.png
