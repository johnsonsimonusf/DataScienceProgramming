# Week-07 Neural Networks
This is a week-07 Neural Networks where we focus on Neural Networks and it's working.
We also utilize different approcahes like Random Search and Grid Search to find the best model when using Neural Network.

## MNIST machine learning exercise

In this exercise we will compare the performance of three different modeling approaches at predicting handwritten numbers. 
We use the MNIST data set: https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/27/MnistExamples.png
